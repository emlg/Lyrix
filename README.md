- <b>img</b> folder: This folder contains several images used in the Lyrix_report notebook.
- <b>webpage</b> folder: This folder contains all the files and explanations needed to run our demo of the project.
- <b>MUSE file creation.ipynb</b>: This notebook will guide you through the creation of files necessary to transfer style with a new pair of genres.

If you would like to run the notebook, you can find the source files (initial file and incremental versions of it) in a zip named data, available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZpbLf_7hdexyVbbuAQm78V45Fvz-HFl7/view?usp=sharing.
