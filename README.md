In this repository you will find the following elements:
- Lyrix_report.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook will explain all the steps of our work on this project (from data collection to prediction). You will be able to follow the 2 different approaches that we implemented.
- img folder: This folder contains several images used in the Lyrix_report notebook.
- webpage folder: This folder contains all the files and explanations needed to run our demo of the project.
- MUSE file creation.ipynb: This notebook will guide you through the creation of files necessary to transfer style with a new pair of genres.

If you would like to run the notebook, you can find the source files (initial file and incremental versions of it) in a zip named data, available here: [link].

We hope that you will enjoy our work,
