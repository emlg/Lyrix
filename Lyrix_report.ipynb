    "- A project generating rap lyrics based on all the Kanye West discography (https://github.com/robbiebarrat/rapping-neural-network)\n",
    "- A project similar to the previous one with the choice of 5 different artists: Tupac, The Beatles, Kanye West, Taylor Swift and Drake (http://www.encore.ai)\n",
    "- This project provides a web parser to gather the lyrics from given artists and predict lyrics from this data (https://github.com/tonybeltramelli/Deep-Lyrics)\n",

    "## Data Gathering\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of this project was to gather a database of lyrics together with their music genre. The quality of this database is determinant to the quality of the results, therefore it is important to spend some time to find the best data possible. However we quickly realised that we would not find such a database available directly on the internet, for the following reasons:\n",
    "- First we need complete lyrics and not only the bag of words contained in the lyrics. Indeed we need the ordering of words in order to predict which one could be next. However, this is difficult to get as the lyrics are protected by Intellectual Property. Consequently there are no open database with entire lyrics available. \n",
    "- We also need the lyrics classified according with the different musical genres. We rarely saw this information with the lyrics. The metadata available was often limited to the author/group, year, title, album.\n",
    "\n",
    "As example of the previous points, we will give the following datasets: the <b>One Million Song Dataset</b>, unfortunately, this dataset contains only the bag of words and the <b>MusicBrainz</b> dataset having the lyrics in order but realized we could only get about a third of the lyrics per song. <br>\n",
    "Our next move was to turn towards the Kaggle website, commonly known to provide good datasets for Machine Learning projects, to look for datasets and found the following one: https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics <br>\n",
    "We decided to use it as a basis to start our work, below you will discover our use of this dataset."

As the result of this project highly depends on this alignment, one could explore more deeply how to increase this number. We could try to reduce the dimension. Later in this notebook, we tried to reduce the number of common words as this would give MUSE more flexibility to align the vocabularies."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the weeks of this project, we encountered multiple challenges and had to make some decisions in order to get as close as possible to our initial goal. If we finally developed two different approaches to mix two musical genres, we are aware that the prediction and complete fusion are not fully operational yet. We will list below different points that could benefit from extra work or thoughts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first difficulty, which revealed itself to be very time consuming, was to get a significant collection of clean lyrics. We already mentionned the issue of the legal protection provided by Intellectual Property, preventing open source lyrics dataset online. This said, the lyrics websites very often rely on human and community participation to transcribe the lyrics. This inevitably implies that the lyrics scrapped from those websites will present many typos or specificities due to the lyrics format (ie, the multiplication of characters to imply some singing effects as \"yyyyyyou\"). We believe that a greater quality of results could be obtained if the lyrics were perfectly cleaned of those artefacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, our second issue was to filter by language. Even with the great help of the <b>detect</b> library, we realized that some verses of songs could be in different languages. This again makes the dataset imperfect as encoding different languages with the same embedding seems conceptually wrong, as the similarity of words among different language is not relevant here.\n",
    "\n",
    "One other point is the genre classification. It is commonly known that even music experts are not always agreeing on every genre classification and we also spotted some artists uncorrectly classified in the initial dataset (e.g. rock artists classified as pop). This said, we could select songs acknowledged as clear representatives of the musical genres chosen. This would require some additional work and could reduce drastically the size of the dataset, as such songs could be rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this thought, we note that our strategy to attribute one main genre to an artist is not optimal. Indeed one artist could explore diversity and have songs with specific characteristics from another genre. We could refine the genre classification and label each song independently. This could be a standalone project.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an attempt to adress the two previous points, we made the decisions to explore only six main genres. This level of granularity could be discussed and improved. One must keep in mind that increasing the refinement of genres will reduce the number of potential songs belonging to this genre and make the genre classification more complicated. This is a trade-off.\n",

    "We also found that the <b>Fasttext</b> library does not compute embeddings for each word from the vocabulary: sometimes it computes embeddings for non-meaningful words but not for grammatically correct english words (e.g. rework was in the lyrics but missing from FastText embeddings). Even though the majority of meaningful words had an embedding, this issue could affect the word predictions as we had to remove the words with no corresponding embeddings from the lyrics. If the reader has the time and patience, we provided the code in this notebook to compute the embeddings of the missing words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concerning the related projects given as litterature at the begining of the notebook, we note that they generally explore smaller and more focused dataset. The datasets are either focused on one given artist or one specific music genre. One advantage is that the cleaning is easier. We also note the use of websites to gather the datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we found the project to be really interesting and managed to identify a few promising examples, shown in this notebook or the demo. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a final word, we would state that this project is indeed a genuine Data Science Project: we spent 80% of our efforts gathering and cleaning data, while we wanted to play more with the neural network 😉"
