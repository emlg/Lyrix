    "The first step of this project was to gather a database of lyrics together with their music genre. We quickly realised that we would not find such a database available directly on the internet, for the following reasons:\n",
    "- First we need entire lyrics and not only the bag of words contained in the lyrics. However this is difficult to get as the lyrics are protected by Intellectual Property. Consequently there are no open database with entire lyrics available. \n",
    "- We also need the lyrics classified according with the different musical genres. We rarely saw this information with the lyrics. The metadata available was often limited to the author/group, year, title, album.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can state as example the following datasets: the One Million Song Dataset, unfortunately, this dataset contains only the bag of words and the MusicBrainz dataset having the lyrics in order but realized we could only get about a third of the lyrics per song. <br>\n",
    "Our next move was to turn towards the Kaggle website to look for datasets and found the following one: https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics <br>\n",

    "- Supervised: using a train bilingual dictionary (or identical character strings as anchor points), learn a mapping from the source to the target space using (iterative) Procrustes alignment.\n",
    "- Unsupervised: without any parallel data or anchor point, learn a mapping from the source to the target space using adversarial training and (iterative) Procrustes refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the unsupervised method as we don't have a matching dictionnary. From our inspection of the low documented code of the MUSE project, we picked the following distance metric : mean_cosine-csls_knn_10 as we understand it as the average of the cosine distance from one point with its 10 nearest neighbors. As it is a cosine distance, the metric needs to grow as close as possible to 1."

However, we noticed that these exclusive words might not appear often and this would reduce the entire size of the training set for our neural net. Moreover, we noticed that these unique words are \"weird\" words because they don't appear at all in all the other lyrics of the other genres.
