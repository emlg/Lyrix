To run this demo, make sure you have all the imports from the 'run_demo.py' file. You will also need the precomputed files available in the <b>data</b> zip file (please download it and unzip it, you don't need to move any file from this archive).<br>
Once this is done, in your Terminal navigate to this webpage directory. <br>
You can now run the following command : <b>python3 run_demo.py </b>. <br>
Finally you just need to open a web browser and enter the following url : <b>localhost:5000 </b>. <br>
Enjoy!
