Let the little girl dance let the little girl dance
She never danced before so let her on the floor 
Let the little girl dance let the little girl dance
She wants to give it a try so let the little girl by 
Shes been a little wallflower on the shelf standing by herself
Now she got the nerve to take a chance so let the little girl dance
Let the little girl through she wants to pass by you
Buddy cant you see she wants to dance with me 
Shes been a little wallflower on the shelf standing by herself
Now she got the nerve to take a chance so let the little girl dance
Let the little girl through she wants to pass by you
Buddy cant you see she wants to dance with me 


Let the little girl dance Many eyes look to the skies never to see me all is lost by the power of
Time and that which must be time I am destroyer of your world my wrath
Won't be surpassed as I down all in my path as time takes its toll upon
The seasons I am the force creating change you have to dream each breath
As it may be your last you can study me but you'll never know just what
Happened in the past Time I am  I am that time Conquest no one will
Evade me my test will you lose your dignity moments that you try to
Embrace get snatched ripped from outta time and space cruel hand of the
Master called time wreaks havoc on you every lifetime time will make its
Final sever nothing ever lasts forever Use me oh so very wisely or grow
Old only to despise me seconds pass who can ever possess moving on with
Such grace and finesse victims caught in a web of quest crying out trying
To achieve their best time I am the only killer of all I am your eternal
DownfallBetween birth and death we must find in ourselves
Keepers of secrets stored on life's shelves
Locked in our souls they key is always the past
Don't hold on to things cause you know that they just never last
Somewhere in time your eternal quest
Your fear of dying will be the first test
Looking for meaning to find some purpose to life
Answers to questions that tear at your heart like a knife
Mysteries are but ephemeral reflections in time
Oceans of wisdom run so deep and sublime
How far have we come left so much behind
Escaping your nature block it out of our mind
Sold us a dream full of pain and despair
So lost in illusion we haven't a prayer
Cycles of change surely to come
As time destroys all all that we've done
Dig in your souls reflect in your hearts
Cause death is behind us to tear us apart
Show you no mercy no mercy at all
The valley of death it echoes its callIt's time to stop this mindless system
System of death that destroys the earth
We're not blind
I see the changes come
Barren toxic wastelands when they're done
Save her save hersave hersave her
Crystal clear waters
Become lakes of poison
Lush green forests destroyed for one reason
Dying generation that brings us down
We got to make the mother fuckers step down
We're gonna bring 'em down
Revolution with a cause
Save the air trees water and the animals
Just for their greed they'll make the sacrifice
World where we live so now we gotta fight
Save her save hersave hersave her
Say goodbyeHave a ball of amphetamines and pour them in your mouth
Take a sip of diphenhydramine when your heart starts going south
Grab your chest and rest and hope for the best when your body starts to react
Take some more when the pain gets sore and hope you get forced to rest 
Take a sip bite your lip and hope that feeling will hold
Use this time to reflect rewind and pray that you're not getting cold
Fall asleep when your eyes grow weak and hope that the feeling will stay
You're in control your body will roll whatever you throw its way
You can tell that everything is going well
And I pray to hell
That you don't start that feeling
While you're in control
You're keeping yourself from growing old
You're body is doing what it's been told
You're not gonna let anything take its hold

Square one when the morning comes you don't have any feeling at all
Your brain is foggy and your thoughts will come with the speed of an outdated gun
So grab your chest rest and hope for the best when your body starts to react
Take your fill and get your thrills and tell them today isn't your last
You can tell that everything is going well
And I pray to hell
That you don't start that feeling
While you're in control
You're keeping yourself from growing old
You're body is doing what it's been told
You're not gonna let anything take its hold
So grab your chest rest and hope for the best when your body starts to react
Take some more when the pain gets sore and hope you get forced to rest
Fall asleep when your eyes grow weak and hope that the feeling will stay
You're in control your body will roll whatever you throw its way
You can tell that everything is going well
And I pray to hell
That you don't start that feeling
While you're in control
You're keeping yourself from growing old
You're body is doing what it's been told
You're not gonna let anything take its hold
Nail slime spidy legs poison ivy rattlesnake lip yes all done most perfect
My pump potion is readyTell me again through which wormhole we slipped
Aided by ketamine barbiturates
Infinite pills and infinite alcohol
Guess we're 'bout ready
Let's go through the list
Cotton balls left on the floor's our first clue
So ether's a culprit
Our lips have turned blue
See discarded whipits
What's sodium pentothal
Bottled up next to the needles we used
Lidocaine does all the pain

Sedatives will calm all our thoughts in our brains
Drugs will all clean us but medicine stains
That's why our prescription's the same
Foreign dimensions again
But we're back to reality friends
Boring's the best that we've been
So let's find a supply
Take a metal vacation or ten
Let's go through the list and we'll see what we took
Heroin's easy needs barely a look
Methadone's mixed in barbiturates too
Let's dig a bit deeper and find something new
Foreign dimensions again
But we're back to reality friends
Boring's the best that we've been
So let's find a supply
Take a metal vacation or
Ten are we dead
Nine I feel fine
Eight I feel great
Seven is this heaven
Six here's your list
Five so let's dive
Four get me more 
Foreign dimensions again
But we're back to reality friends
Boring's the best that we've been
So let's find a supply
Take a metal vacation or ten
Oh 
OhYou're alone in a blackedout room bound feet pressed to the floor
On your own been attacked but soon long teeth less lack of gore
Drug of choice taken minutes before hooded men walked through your door
Quiet voice clicking latch that score's settled quick but you need more
You're alone in a whitelit hall bloodied hands clutch tornup meat
Monotone humming bright spit pooled round stance cut short of sleep
Stagger up to the brushed steel door tear the whole thing off the wall
Dagger fangs at a hush still bored bared soul I'll kill you all
Now the fast's in the past and at last you can eat your fill at will
Singing on and on and on and on
This song's the one you'll never write down
And you won't remember it when you wake up on a concrete floor among the dismembered
Not right or natural
A factual reality a chemical ability to kill
You're alone in a blacked out room keeping dark thoughts from your brain
Ringing phone gin and crack festooned on the floor to keep you sane
You await for the mutation to approach and end your life
All of this just a ruse built up just a joke to end sore spite
Now the fast's in the past and at last gotta eat your fill at will
Hands feet heart meat repeat no feat keep up on kills
Hot breath on your neck cold sweats gonna end your sorry life
Singing on and on and on and on
This song's the one you'll never write down
And you won't remember it when you wake up on a concrete floor among the dismembered
Not right or natural
A factual reality a chemical ability to kill
It's not natural no
The actual ability to killWell I've been sitting in the back seat of this car for half an hour and I'm wondering if any of this is real
Trouble is I ate a pound of psychedelic mushrooms and now I'm trying to decide if I should feel weird about the fact that both my friends who went and drove me to the Burger King can tell that I'm fucked up
Because their alligator faces leering at me from the front seat have that look of frightened deerinheadlights locked
Hissing Calm down that bitter taste's the drug and no you won't drown on spit
So cool it swallow we'll be downtown now in just a couple minutes
We don't have to talk until you're fine
So now I'm sitting on the curb amazed by traffic
All the cars have rockets bolted to their roofs and reptile men driving
Wonder if the lights that spin atop these ambulances always looked as cool as they have been
And no one can tell me Calm down
That bitter taste's their stares
And no you won't drown on spit
So cool it swallow take a breath sit tight for just a single minute
We can talk again when they get lost
Then we'll sail as high as we wanna go
None of you can tell us no
Or tell us that we'll fail
Cause we're too far gone to care
And time goes way too slow
Let's pick up the pace and go
Doubletime this beat and wail
No one rests until we're there
Well I guess we should worry a bit
Cause they'll lock us up if we can't learn to cool it
We're having a party instead
Who cares if it's only inside of our heads
We've got mutants and angels and demons and rockets and killers
Obnoxious Fuck you man I've got this
Let's stay on this trip tell the world it don't know anything
Glad you're here to hang out
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Baby I know you love me
Make me strong don't make me weak
Give me that candy
Play with my mind
You're begging me down
Let's make this strong
I know that you want
Baby
And I won't be too long

Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Gotta make that change
We gotta all make that change
My brothers and my sisters
It's time to make this world a private place
For the generation to come
Can find love and peace
What for the last of it
So I'm gonna tell you over and over again
Brothers sisters let's sing to it
From the heart
Come on
Come on

All I'm asking
All I'm asking
Just give love
Love a chance
I've been thinking about you so long
But time just slip away
I wonder how your life has gone baby
Since I've been away
Can't let it pass me by
Won't let it pass me by
Not a single day baby
These words I'm tryin to say now

I've been thinking what to say
If you walked through that door
All the walls we build around us

You might be a man stay a man but you wont be the same
If you ain't gonna do me right
I might just do you in
Ain't it a sin
Ain't it a sin
I try to find a certain style
To keep my soul from runnin' wild
My emotion got the best of me

If you ain't gonna do me right
I might just do you in
Ain't it a sin

I feel so sad
I lost the best friend
That I ever had
She was my woman
I loved her so
But it's too late now
I've let her go
I'm going through changes
I'm going through Changes 
We shared the years
We shared each day
In love together
We found a way
But soon the world
Had its evil way
My heart was blinded
Love went astray
I'm going through changes
I'm going through Changes 
It took so long
To realize
That I can still hear her
Last goodbyes
Now all my days
Are filled with tears
Wish I could go back
And change these years
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
In my life in my life
There gotta be a change in my life

To make it in America
A land of milk and honey
A land supposed to be built with love
It take love and understanding
To live and let live
I was born in Gainesville Florida
I traveled far and wide
Then I moved to Brooklyn New York
Had hard times for sometime I hold on
Why is it so hard
To make it in America
I try so hard
To make it in America
Seemed like nothing was goin' right
So I said to myself
You got to move away from here
I went to upstate New York
A little town they call Poughkeepsie
Got me a job
To get away from all this stress
But I couldn't get away
No matter how far I went
Seems like nothing gonna change
Everything still remained the same
Why is it so hard
To make it in America
I try so hard
To make it in America
Why tell me tell me
We gotta make a change in America
Help me somebodyRound and round the road we go again
Where we started nobody knows
It's a cold cold world it's a cold cold world
How can we stop the changes going in America today
Come back come back to the golden rule

Just a whisper in the wind
I though he was important to your heart
Thought I was the icing on your cake
I thought it was going according to the plan
Was that mistake
Now someone is in love and someone is in liking
Someone's holding on with all their mind
And someone's lefti 'n' go no kiss goodbye oh no
And someone is the answer to the question why
Is that all our love has been
Just a whisper in the wind
Is that all our love has been
Just a whisper in the wind
Don't get about my time my shoulder was your savior
Remember how we used to smile through thick and thin
I would never tell you
If I was your mind you were my parts inside
Your lies can tie our hands we were free just you and me free
You meant so much to me baby
Now look around the room is empty the room is empty
Is that all our love has been
Just a whisper in the wind
Is that all our love has been
Just a whisper in the wind
The petals from my love's flower keep falling falling
And I have  my heart stuck of love I can hear you calling calling
Say it loud say  could  maybe why it's so  tell me
And in my vision there's indecision
It's tormented 
Is that all our love has been
Just a whisper in the wind
Is that all our love has been
Just a whisper in the wind
Just a whisper in the wind
Just a whisper in the wind
Is that all that has been
Is it all that I was to you tell me the truth
Tell me the truth I can take it

First of all I'd like to say good evening
And we're so pleased that
So many of you could come out and share
In all the love and all the happiness we have in store for you
We want you to have a real good time
'Cause that's just what we have in mind
Is that alright with you
Now this is a tune that I composed
And it's called
Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman
Now I never intended recording this song
It was a personal poem
This is until the day that my producer
Happened to thumb through the pages of my notebook
He came across the words and he said
We got to somethin' with these words
It's happening every day
And people wanna hear about it Betty
You see it's the story of a young girl
Making love for the very first time
Now when I finally got a melody
I took it home and II played it for my mother
Now I got to tell you a little bit about my mother
You see I come from one of those pretty large families
And I'm the baby of the family
And you know you never grow up to your mother
I'll never forget the way she looked at me when I played it forher
She said Uh I like the music
You know baby the melody it's really nice
But I know you're not gonna sing that song
But we eased it right on by yes we did
And it became one of my biggest records too
So I want you to do this for me if you will
Everybody think back to your very first time
Now I'll give you a little while longer
'Cause I know some of you
Have to think back a little further than others
Come on now I want you to play catchup
'Cause I don't want you waitin' till I get to the end of my song
Sayin' Oh yeah now I remember
Now whether it was good
Or you just smilin' it was good
Or on the other hand if it was not so good
Here's my story
Hm hm mm mm
Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman mm
You said you'll be gentle with me
And II hope you will mm mm
I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
I'm tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still no
I can hear your car door slammin'
I wanna play big girl and put on a sexy smile
But I know so little about what love is
I just can't help actin' like a child
You're knockin' on my door and you're ringin' my bell
Hope you're not impatient after waiting so very long
A whole year I put you off with my silly hangups
And we're both old enough to know right from wrong
Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman mm
You said you'll be gentle with me
And II hope you will hmm mm
I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
Tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still
Mm hey baby
Ho ho baby
Ho yeah yeah
Oh but what if my mama should come home early
And catch us doin' what we're doin'
Not only will I never live it down
But my whole family relationship it'll all be ruined
But we've gone a little bit too far now
Oh to turn around
So let's just pray
That true love is what we've found
Tonight tonight

Daddy always told me to be real
Daddy always said that I should say just what I feel
People they will judge you cause they just don't understand
You're in it for the long ride you don't just give up on a man
And like every woman who's been through the fire as well
We ALL got a story half afraid to tell yeah
People they will judge you 'cause they just can't comprehend
You're headed for the long ride you don't just give up on a friend
 Gone to where the sun shines all the time
 Though some might think we've lost our minds
 our legacy divine
It's just that we're so different makes our place a little harder to find

Grapes on a vine don't always make sweet wine
Grapes on a vine yeah don't always make sweet wine
Grapes on a vine don't always make sweet wine
Might be bitter but it gets better with time
Momma always said that it's okay to dream
Momma always warned me things ain't always what they seem 
People they will judge you leave you sittin' on a shelf
Remember it's a long ride just don't you give up on yourself
And like every man who wants to make his mark
We ALL got a secret hidden in our hearts yeah 
People they will judge us 'cause they just don't really see
We're in it for the long ride just don't you give up on you and me no

Uh uh
Grapes on a vine ain't nuttin' sweet
You gotta pay the price just keep your receipt
I can make the world have a seat on my feet
And I come from New Orleans where the water too deep
Money bring problems the funny thang 'bout it
Everybody want it want it 'til they got it
Sometimes I forget and put my trouble in my pockets
Then hang up my pants now I got monsters in my closet
Get right with me Miss Wright with me
Die hard I got too much life in me
Shades on I'm seein' past that
Bittersweet wine where your glass at
Toast You haters are ghost
I make y'all sick you need a full dose ha
And my momma told me do me
And stay away from that fruit tree because


So do you do you do you
 Be your own best friend
 Be your own best friend

Be your own best friend

You gotta love on you before anybody else can learn to
You gotta love you LOVE you yeah love you love youGimme back my man
Gimme back my man
Gimme back my man
Gimme back my man
Take this horseshoe
It can't do what my man can do
Not looking maybe
but it ain't doin' a thing for me
You can have this four leaf clover
It can't do a good job of holding me
Take all these lucky charms
I'd rather be in my man's arms
Lucky charms I don't need
They don't do a thing for me
And I know without a doubt
It's my man's love I can't do without
So
Gimme back my man
Gimme back my man
Gimme back my man
Just gotta have my man
I went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
She took my hand in hers
And this is what she said
Give up your man
As she began to read my palm
You can find yourself a better one
If you take these lucky charms
Oh what a fool I was to give that man away
I hope it's not too late
To correct the mistake I made
But sure as the sun rises in the east and
the sun sets in the west
I declare ain't nowhere
have I found a better man
yeah
'Cause lucky charms is a fantasy
Can't be living in a world of make believe
Getting all built up for a big let down
Waitin' for my love to roll all around
Life's too short to believe in those things
I'd rather have mine while all the things
So
Gimme back my man
Gimme back my man listen to me
Gimme back my man yeah
Just gotta have my man
You can have this old rabbit's foot
I never did like like the way it looked
And you can even have the penny in the case
'Cause it will never ever take my man's place
'Cause lucky charms are a fantasy
They don't mean a thing to me
And I know without a doubt
It's my man's love I can't do without
So
Gimme back my man hey yeah
Gimme back my man mmh
Gimme back my man yeah
Just gotta have my man
Give him back
Need him back
Yes I do
Want him back hey yeah
Ooh ooh yeah
Gimme gimme gimme backIt's very ordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
Girls we make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life
She takes the time to listen
To what he has to say
While all you do is nag him
A thousand times a day
Her hair is always pretty
And her clothes are always stylish
But you greet him with your hair in rollers
And that's outdated and so childish
Oh it's very ordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
We make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life
Are you there when he needs you
Are your favors less than cute
And when he tries to love you
Do you find something else to do
Now the ordinary girl may not wear pearls
Or diamonds on each hand
Oh but like the secretary wooh
She knows how to please her man
Oh it's not extraordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
You see we make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life hey hey
You see life's a bowl of cherries
For all the secretaries hey hey
Oh it's very ordinary it's not extraordinary
Girls don't be contrary or you'll make it necessary
Your life can be so merry just like the secretary
Life's a bowl of cherriesA clean up woman is a woman who
Gets all the love we girls leave behind
The reason I know so much about her
Is because she picked up a man of mine
Jumpin' slick was my ruin
'Cause I found out all I was doin'
Was makin' it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love aww yeah
Just makin' it easy for the clean up woman
To get my baby's love huh huh
I took this man's love and put it on a shelf
And like a fool I thought I had him all to myself
When he needed love I was out havin' fun
But I found out that all I had done
Was made it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love huh huh
Yeah that's what I did
I made it easy for the clean up woman
To steal my baby's love aw yeah
The clean up woman will wipe his blues away
She'll give him plenty lovin' twenty four hours a day
The clean up woman she'll sweep him off his feet
She's the one who'll take him in when you dump him in the street
So take a tip you better get hip
To the clean up woman 'cause she's tough
I mean she really cleans upFun thing

Don't blink why this stupid battle
A curse it aggrivates the metal
Outburst ain't it ever gonna settle down next time
I'm gonna even the score
You find that they'll be back for moreLast week I saw you at the Junkie Church
You told me all the things I need to hear
Like I've got a heart of gold
And a kind and open soul
So we went and bought ourselves a can of beer
Steel Reserve
I was manic at the clinic
I was feeling like my body disappeared
My tongue rolling around
In the void inside my mouth
It was infinite and brown and kind of weird
Infinite
And the waiting room was pissing in my ear
The waiting room was pissing in my ear
So we went and bought ourselves a can of beer
Steel Reserve
Oh I love you 'cause I love you 'cause I can
I love you 'cause I love you 'cause I can
Last time I tried to go to sleep
My head expanded in an air balloon of words
A thousand conversations
With your disembodied voice
In a cacophony of adjectives and verbs
Air balloon
On your last night at Saint Mary's
You were way too intoxicated to breathe
So I used your ribs as ladders
And I climbed up on your chest
And I jumped up and down just like a trampoline
Trampoline
And the ambulance was mean as it could be
It melted both my tennies to the street
That night I stole a candy bar from Circle K
Milky WayOh God there's a big one coming on
The dead have begun to rise and walk
And nobody is singing nobody is singing
The bottomless pit has opened up
The Virgin Mary's crying blood
And nobody is singing nobody is singing
Were all taking pictures with camera phones
To prove that we were there
For the end of days the end of days
The blood gollum is on the loose again
He doesn't know that were American
He just thinks we're fatter
The hell demons are killing all in sight
Satan's doing wheelies on his bike
Twin heads on his handlebars
Pigtailed twins around the age of 666
Their faces painted to look like King Diamond and Peter Criss
For the end of days the end of days
Now its raining semen
It smells like those summer trees you smell
Could this be the revelation or is it simply the end of Hell
Oh God there's a big one coming on
Hashtag armageddon
That topic is trending
The death cult is making jewelry
From the corpses they dragged from the burning sea
They're taking eyes they're taking ears they're taking noses they're taking teeth
They're taking hair and skin from tattoos
They're taking fingers they're taking
The end of days very seriously
Now the valley is flooded
With piranha tequila and knives
But at least we got to prove that we did something worthwhile with our lives
At the end of days the end of days
Edit Lyrics Edit Wiki Add VideoThere was a time
When I would unravel
And drown in the snow
There was a time
When getting murdered
Would feel like a joke
But I'm Alive
Don't let me die
Now that I'm at the top of my game
There was a time
When I'd apologize
When I should have been saying 'Thank You'
Times when I'd be filled with shame
Over things that everybody goes through
But now I'm free
I like being me
Now that I'm at the top
Now that I'm at the top
Now that I'm at the top of my game
I get stronger
With every punch
And every kick
And every rock that hits my back
And every time that I get sick
Oh I get stronger too
There is still times when I feel sad as hell
And there are times I downright scare myself
Times when the rage inside me swells
Into a big black tidal wave
And I feel like an idiot
But I know I can deal with it
Now that I'm at the top
Now that I'm at the top
Now that I'm at the top of my gameI was throttled to the ground
I was locked inside a basement
the guards went on vacation while I plotted my revolt
I was tired and confused
doesn't look like that is changing
I'm a hallucination of myself at 3 years old
goodbye oh goodbye
you were perched atop my shoulder
you were pecking at my head
and if I had a hole to crawl in I would be there and be dead
you were spilling all my will out
I was bleeding my last brains
it's nothing like the nothingness that normally numbs ones pain
goodbye oh goodbye
7th grade was hard enough
if someone thought that they knew me
if I stay in bed long enough
they'll go to church without me
if I move away enough
they won't outrun me
goodbye
oh goodbye Hey little girl
Where you been so long
Is it true that you
Been hurt and treated wrong
Now I heard that John Doe
Broke your heart in two
If you give me chance
I'll take care of you
Cause you're the answer to
My one and only prayer
Girl I love you
Now I remember when
You were just sixteen
I remember that
I remember that
And everybody knew
You were my teenage queenooooh yeah
As I look at you now
You still the best I see
So I won't be satisfied
Till you wear you wear my ring
Oooh noWell
Yes you did
You know I talk
To my baby
I talk to her
Late last night
And she said
That she's still waiting
She said that if I hurry home
Everything gonna be alright
She said I don't mind waiting 'cause I never can get enough of your love
So I went to the train station
And bought a one way ticket back home
You see I realized what I was missing
Because I heard it I heard it in the little
That little girl's voice
She said I don't mind waiting 'cause I never can get enough of your love
Oh that's what she said
Never get enough of your love
She said I never never never never get enough of your love
Now I don't know
If you've had this problem
But if you did
You better take my take my advice
You better stay stay at home
And never leave never leave the little girl alone
Or you may never hear her say
I don't mind waiting 'cause I never can get enough of your love
She said I don't mind waiting 'cause I never can get enough of your love
And you don't know how good it made me feel
When I heard her say never
Never get enough of my love
You don't know how good it made me feel
Oh no I never never get enough
Never get enough
She said I neverYou never tell me no when you know I'm going to ask
But like a woman in your way you show
That you're always willing share the same feeling
Love is you

When you smile I know everything about you Lord
And when you touch me and whisper real softly
You say you're ready then call me sweet daddy

And make sure you watch your TV every day
And take nothing for granted

It's like holding back the ocean
Trying to hold onto your mind
Don't forget the reason
Why you started in the first place
It's a struggle like no other for the fate of humankind

And I bust them blind
And I am no longer mine

nobody on the street and everybody knows
that they're running out of time
they're waiting on the line
and their laughing out of clothes
they're all locked in and watching our old videos
smoking cigarettes and fingers going up their nose
and their wasting all their time
thinking everything is fine
no caring what jim knows
I don't bother to ask why
when you're sitting home and crying
no time to move a toe
I don't care why
I need more time
I don't care why
I need more timeWell I'm just sick and tired of talking on the phone
Sitting in your room conversing all alone
Talking talking talking about everybody else
What you'd rather do is talk about yourself
Don't talk to me
Not even a word
Not even a whisper
Just bite your lip
Don't talk to me
I don't have a case of bloody laryngitis
When we're sitting in a room with no one there besides us
'cause I'm sick and tired of listening to your neurotic shit
Why don't you ever shut your mouth stop acting like a twit
Don't talk to me
Chi chi chi chi chi
Chatter chatter chatter
When you talk to me I'm letting
Don't know what's the matter
Got to tie your hands feet put you in a safe
Don't talk to me
You never talk to meno words to this songThey cruise in unmarked vans
Your parts are in their hands
Control you with a shack of light
They're done with tv screens
They're using laser beams
You'll dream of microwaves tonight
Uhoh
No
You can resist the call
Go to the shopping mall
There's just so much for you to buy
They're everywhere you go
They are inside your home
There is no point in asking why
You're so much happier
Your life is such a blur
There is no interest till you die
Uhoh

Uhoh

Cross my heartI walk the streets on a saturday night
the skies are dim but the neon is bright
the lights are warm but the pavement is cold
love is bought and bodies are sold
Doesn't mean a thing to me
I'm just one of so many
I don't feel a thing at all
I'm not waiting for your call
I'm not in love
and I don't want to
I'm good for nothing
'cause nothing is true
People searching about tonight
Looking for someone
No one seems right
the  warm and bodies are cold
Love is bought and bodies are soldI'm having erratic dreams
Coming apart at the seams
I gotta get away
If I don't get away I'm gonna break it all
Everyone is trying to tear me apart
I'm going straight from the end back to the start
Doesn't matter where I run I always run into a wall
Oh no
Don't talk pretend not to hear
I'm always living a lie
I'm always living in fear
So now I'm gonna go figure out I'm not one of them at all
I  like rats on the page
You know I right them all down and then I tear up the page
I gotta scare them out of here
Oh no
Oh yeahCall it call it up again
The commies are coming and I hear you say
Who cares who knows Maybe I will one day
Who knows what you're gonna say
Not me
Who knows when your turn will be
Not me
Join the professionals
Be a professional
Join the professionals today
A kick in the head every day for a year
Wouldn't even need me going there
Shock the heart secretly for me
Do they really have a say
What goes on with you each day
Who knows what you're gonna say
Not me
Who knows when your turn will be
Not me
Join the professionals
Be a professional
You're gonna be one anyway

Razorblades and vaseline what I see is synthesized
Photographs and magazines will accept no compromise
Radio and nicotine all of them are synthesized
Synthesized Synthesized
Every day now more and more names and faces obsolete
See the movement on the floor always listen to the beat
One by one    stream every movement synchronized
Dancing like they're in a dream everything is synthesized
Synthesized Synthesized
Calling cards and catalogs sacrificed for their disguise
Disconnecting analogs anything to synthesize
Nothing here is what it seems nothing  will be recognized
Perfect fit for the Machine everyone is synthesized
Synthesized Synthesized Synthesized SynthesizedI comprehend that there's a danger that you might misapprehend the way things are You look to me like you're a stranger perhaps you've come here from afar I've been down here for oh so many years I scarcely know this now  the things they do But my advice is that you go back home you're much too beautiful they're bound to ruin you You better run we're watching watching you better dart we're waiting waiting while we're waiting for you lives are cold  Little man how'd you get in get in You're goona die while wondering wondering wondering more about you lives unfold Please please I don't think this world is right take me take me back to space and light please please I'm afraid take me somewhere take me somewhere I'll beIt's you

Oh yes I amI was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it
'Cause deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hands see
Education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
For life had kick him down to the ground
When he tried to get up
Life would kick him back down
One day Papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders
And in his tears he said
He said Patches
I'm dependin' on you son
To pull the family through
My son it's all left up to you
Two days later Papa passed away and
I became a man that day
So I told Mama I was gonna quit school but
She said that was Daddy's strictest rule
So every mornin' 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said Patches
I'm dependin' on you son
I tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest
Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of 13 I thought
I was carryin' the weight of the
Whole world on my shoulders
And you know Mama knew
What I was goin' through 'cause
Every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my Mama pray
Lord give him the strength to make another day
So years have passed and all the kids are grown
The angels took Mama to a brand new home
Lord knows people I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice kept me through the years
Sing
Patches I'm dependin' on you son
To pull the family through
My son it's all left up to you
Oh I can still hear Papa's voice sayin'
Patches I'm dependin' on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest
I can still hear Papa what he said
Patches I'm dependin' on you son
To pull the family through
My son it's all left up to youBaby I ain't going down that road of love by myself
No no I ain't going down that road of love by myself
Now if you won't go with me baby
I guess I'll just have to get somebody else
Oh darling I hope you feel the same way too
Baby I sure hope you feel the same way too
Cause as long as we have each other
I'll have your love to see me through now
And ohh baby let's walk together hand in hand
Ohh baby baby baby let's walk together hand in hand oh lord
And you can be my little woman now
And I know I know I'm gonna be your man
What I think now
I like what I'm listening to right now
Oh baby let's walk together hand in hand
Oh oh oh baby let's walk together hand in hand
And you can be my little woman
I know I know I'm gonna be your man
Don't make me walk by myself baby
I just don't walk by myself now now now baby
Ohhh baby I ain't going down the road by myself
Oh no now if you won't go with me darling
I guess I'll have to get somebody else
Ohh baby don't leave me stay with me
Take care of me baby ohh babyWhat would I give for just a few moments
What would I give just to have you near
Tell me you will try to slip away somehow
Oh I need you darling I want to see you right now
Can you slip away Slip away slip away
Oh I need you so
Love oh love how sweet it is
When you steal it darling
Let me tell you somethin'
Now how sweet it is
Now I know it's wrong
The things I ask you to do
But please believe me darling
I don't mean to hurt you
But could you just slip away
Without him knowing you're gone
Then we could meet somewhere
Somewhere where we're both are not known
And can you slip away Slip away slip away
I need you so
Oh can you slip away baby
I'd like to see you right now darling
Can you slip away now baby
'Cause I got to I got to see you
I feel a deep burning inside
Oh I wish you could slip awayMan I can understand how it might be
Kind of hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
It's my own fault for what happens to my heart
You see I've always known you'd go
But you just do what you gotta do
My wild sweet love
Though it may mean I'll never kiss your sweet lips again
Pay that no mind
Just find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can
Well I know they make you sad
They make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me like you should
Folks got ways to make you feel no good
I'd guess they've got no way to know
I've had my eyes wide open from the start
And boy you never lied to me
And the part of you they'll never see
Is the part you've shown to me
So you just do what you gotta do
My wild sweet love
Though it may mean I'll never kiss those sweet lips again
Pay that no mind
Just find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me
Come on back and see me when you canI'm all alone and fancy free

And we don't believe you oughta be a bringin' up your little girl this way
Yeah it was signed by the secretary Harper Valley PTA
Well it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard I can still recall the words she had to say
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA
Well now there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice whenever he's away

 ohLike a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights
Consumed by the shadows
And was crippled emotionally
Somehow I made it through the heartace
I escaped
I found my way out of the darkness kept my faith
Kept my faith
And the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high
I still believed
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me
With and endless desire
I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
And like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over
One touch and you set me free
I don't regret a single moment
Looking back when I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh I just laugh
And the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high
I still believed
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting
So we were drawn together through destiny
I know this love we share was meant to be
It's only loveStart up moving out bidding a farewell to the past
Step down look around everybody growing up fast
Everything you love is gonna die and that's the way that it goes
Lose touch call back even if it's just a hello
Don't you keep 'em waiting
System Operating
Always have a place to hide
Wake up think back often in the dead of the night
Staying up black and white memories of what it was like
Love hate all about a better time and now it's gone
Call out Never mind when you're gonna get a response
Don't you keep 'em waitin'
System Operating
Always have a place to hide
Oh through those darkest nights
You're somewhere behind the light
In a chorus of fire
Oooooh his moments pass us by
You're somewhere behind the light
In a chorus of fire
Don't you keep 'em waitin'
Time Accumulating
Always have a place to hide
Oh through those darkest nights
You're somewhere behind the light
In a chorus of fire
Get out Get out anyway you can
Well you can't blame something when there's nothing out there
Run out run out run away with me
Well I can't stay here and it might as well be somewhere
Lookout lookout the devil is everywhere
If you don't watch out he will sell your soul for nothing
Well this can't be wrong
Well we can't go back
Now we've made our choice
So I say let's go
Come on come on come and play with me
If you don't get scared this will be your life forever
I know I know something isn't right
And I'd call someone but I can't even remember
Come on come on you know he's a whore
If you stop this game well you might as well surrender
Get out Get out anyway you can
Well you've gone this far isn't this the life you came for
Get out Get out while you canYou say that I am home now
But I don't feel that it's right
So what the difference
They want to hold you
I can tell you
That you won't go
We are all your friends here and we will show you
All of those Vampires
They come to see me
Cause I'm what they desire
I'm what they're looking for
We'll say when you will go down
But don't you see it's our right
You feel the distance
When we control you
I can tell you
That you won't go
We are all your friends here and we will show you
Repeat chorusCan I be what you ask of me
Then maybe I'm not what you want
The money is nice but I want to go home
Is that the price I pay to be here
Tell me what's wrong
So I can make things right
And no one does it quite like me
The money is wrong but I can't get it back
But I will tell you what you're doing for me
Nice
You're all mine
You make me feel so young
I said la la la la la la la
When you sing it sounds so good
The moment is right and I'm taking you home
And you will do the things I ask of you
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la laAnother time another place so long ago
Welcome to the show
Life has a way of making bad things look like fun
The show has just begun
It's not so fun when they come for me
I don't like what I see
Welcome one welcome all to The Grand Guignol
Welcome to the show
If you watch it you might go insane
Can I close my eyes and wish it away
They told me that it's just a play
It's nothing like the world we live in today
So all you folks sit back and enjoy the show
It's not for everyone
You're gonna wish that you had changed your mind
It happens every time
You can do with me as you please I'll be your disease
Another day another play at The Grand Guignol
We are the show
REPEAT CHORUS
TodayYou're right
I'm sodepressed
Kill myselfIt's just an illusion you've lost your way
Your state of confusion won't go away
This is Blood Money and they'll take what they need
There's no one to stop them
When it's time to feed
This is Blood Money
This is Blood Money
YOU WILL DO WHAT WE SAY
YOU WILL WATCH WHAT WE SAY
YOU WILL BUY WHAT WE SAY
YOU WILL DIE WHEN WE SAY
They'll fuck with your future
They fucked with your past
Don't be so happy cause it won't last
This is Blood Money you have nothing left
Just find a dark corner
And wait for your death
This is Blood Money
This is Blood Money
Repeat chantSometimes I wish I could go away
I'm no good to anyone
Reflection if I could change my ways
Redemption like you would care
This is my life
And this is what I've made it
I live my lie
And this is how I fake it
I hate myself
Deceive you and take your life away
Temptation you are to blame
I hate the man I've become
Perception I'll never change
This is my life
This is my sin and sorrow
Don't pray for me
My crucifixion follows
IhatemyselfI am alive and it's all because of your misfortune
You will not survive
But you'll have my full devotion
Why Wont You do what you need to be among us
Try Die is that what you want
It will be forever
Make up your mind
Why can't you be like all the others
That wasn't so bad don't be sad now
Because I forgive you
Why Wont You do what you need to be among us
Try Die is that what you want
It will be foreverI've been waiting waiting for so long
Keeps the cold out
What did I do wrong
Why'd you storm out
What did I do wrong
What's your hurry
Let me sing my song
'I used to be just what you wanted you cried
I've been waiting waiting for so long
Keeps the cold out
What did I do wrong
Why'd you storm out
What did I do wrong
What's your story
What could be so wrong
'I used to be just what you wanted you cried

It used to be so good when I was young

I used to be just what you wanted but you criedPlease don't cry that's not the way I want to go
I did the best that I could
The sacred souls of the reluctant few
Wander the world like they should
You said my life was so different
You said you loved me for me
You said I was one in a million
Isn't that what you believe
Don't think you have to say something
I don't expect that of you
You are just like all the others
Nothing that speaks of the truth
Well the streets don't shine like I was led to believe
How could you do this to me
You serve up your swill when it's time to feed
You say it's the way it will be
You said my life was so different
You said you loved me for me
You said I was one in a million
Isn't that what you believe
Don't think you have to say something
I don't expect that of you
You are just like all the other
Nothing that speaks of the truthYou take whatever we give you
We are indebted to you
More money more fish to skin
Just keep on reading that shit we spew
We gather at Oleander
You shower us with your love
More wine more drugs than you can imagine
Don't thank me it's all for fun
This is our sanctuary
You're making our dreams come true
Your lives are ordinary
We take whatever we want from you
This is just life's illusion
You'd better get used to it
Less money more bills to pay for
It's something that I won't doI can't decide for myself
No one gave me courage when I tried
I don't see a reason for my life
Who will know the difference when I die
I don't have to worry of things I heard today
I don't really have the time
And no one seems to care
Ahhhhhahhhhhh
Righttonight
Can you see the shadows in their eyes
Can you see the trouble in their lives
Help me find the words I have to say
Either way they're laughing in my face
I don't have to worry of things I heard today
I don't really have the time
And no one seems to care
Ahhhhhahhhhhh
RighttonightWhat is wrong Am I hearing things
Did I just hear someone's voice calling me
I'll make sure that I'm not alone or to fend for myself in this unhappy home
He'll take pity on my damaged soul
He's the one that cares for you when I'm all alone
Heed my words for what I say is true
He's the one they call duende and he waits for you
Walls fall and you beg for mercy
No one sees me I don't really care
End all of your petty hatred in the land of the dead no one really cares
I need my soul to be at peace
I am stuck in this void with all who are deceased
I'll be there to torment your home
I am duende to you and you are not alone
Conquer your fear if you dare
I will find you I promise I'll be there
I swear
What is wrong Am I hearing things
Did I just hear someone's voice calling me
I'll make sure that I'm not alone
Or to fend for myself in this unhappy home
Conquer your fear if you dare
I will find you I promise I'll be there
I'll make sure you don't stay another day in this unhappy homeIf you want what's best
But you don't have everything
But you'll take from me yeah
Say just one surprise
If you feel like like you want to go
You don't you want to stay
So do you want anything Yeah
You want You cry You watch
I represent indulgence to feed our vital existence
Undefiled wisdom instead of selfdeceit
Responsibility to the responsible do what thou wilt
For your gratification do what thou wilt
You say I'm so like you same soul
If you want what's best
But you don't have everything
But you'll take from me yeah
Say just one surprise
And you feel like like you want to cheat
Say that you want to go sure
Anytime Anywhere yeah
You want You cry You watchI applaud your persistence
You're my path of least resistance
I'm your jury I'm your judge
You can thank me

What I do is inexcusable
It's what I'm good at
What I do is inexcusable
One MoreCrisis
Is what we have here It's what it is
For myVices
It's what I live for
You paid for this
You keep living in your squalor
And I'll just sit here and take your last dollar
How do you do it Why do you fight
You should know by now you have no rights
What I do is inexcusable
It's what I'm good at
What I do is inexcusable
Repeat ChorusThe news took us all by surprise
When Mr Dark came and swept you away
You had a look of sheer bliss on your face
And you wanted to end your life that way
Wasn't it you that said death was your last resort
You made it your right to set yourself free
How does it feel to have a god that doesn't give a shit
Mr Dark will put your soul at ease
I felt the blood run cold in my veins
And the pain in my heart too much to bear
Where was your god when you needed him the most
That's what happens when you have a god that doesn't care
Wasn't it you that said death was your last resort
Mr Dark will take care of you
How does it feel to have a god that doesn't give a fuck
Now Mr Dark will set your soul at ease

Wasn't it you that said death was your last resort
You made it your right to set yourself free
How does it feel to have a god that doesn't give a shit
Mr Dark will set your soul at easeWhat do you want from me
It's not enough that you can plainly see
It makes no difference that I'm much too young
But you don't care because you're never wrong
But I will give no more and you'll be sad when I walk out that door
I'll be sure to tell them everything and your merry men will gladly sing
And they'll sing about you
I was put on this earth without any worth
Now I'm hating my life cause it don't mean much to me
If you have it rough well you ain't so tough
It'll be a joy to see you shrivel up and die
And you know why
I was put on this earth without any worth
Now I'm hating my life cause it don't mean much to me

If you have it rough
Well you ain't so tough
It'll be a joy to see you shrivel up and die
What do you want from me
I was put on this earth without any worth
Now I'm hating my life cause it don't mean much to meSinging the songs of loneliness
Is what I think about when you are gone
Someone told me I was wrong
Who do you pray for Father Garces
Do you ever pray for guys like me
For my pain and misery
I will drown here
Someone save me
People with money get all your blessings
What are we for you to leave behind
You must think that we don't mind
Don't waste your time with the poor and homeless
They don't pay enough to save their souls
Now I'm feeling so alone
Repeat chorus
What you said was wrong to me
What gives you the nerve
Can't you stay and comfort me
Is that what I deserve
Repeat chorus2 3 4
I sit here I'm watching and wondering
How things could have gotten this way
I'm actually seeing the end of the world
The freaks in control now have taken a hold
Of the things I remember the most
What did you do to my world
How did you fuck up my world again
This is my world
Why do you keep saying it's yours
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Nothing is real but the freaks make you feel
Like it's all going to end any day
I can't believe in your word
I can't' believe in your wordI will show no mercy I will take you all
It is my decision you will take this fall
I make lots of money this is what I do
I will take your dignity and your freedom too
Where are you
HIDE
This job is my birthright I will never leave
I'm a just and fair man if that's what you believe
This is not a witch hunt I'm cleaning up this town
You'd better leave while you can or I will take you down
Where are you
HIDE
I'm the judge and jury you will do as I say
And if someone bothers me I'll make them go away
I've been here forever I am all you know
Listen to what I say or you're the next to go
This is my dominion I enforce the law
Judges in my pocket they have no say at all
No one is safe around me I have no friends around
Either way I would turn them in I'm the king of Oil townThis strange man comes to me and says he says what are you doing here son
He said Moe get your shit together man cause I don't do this just for anyone
Your life your mess it's your fault I guess I can fix it just don't fuck it up again
So tell me was it worth it
Now that your soul is mine
I don't make you nervous do I
It happens every time
He says to me for a small fee
I can make shit happen that you wouldn't believe
And with a wave of his hand all is good in the land
When does my new life begin
For what it's worth your time on earth will be joyous
He howls as he laughs at me
Hey man you owe me big time now
Just remember that all this happened because of me
You will come to regret this
It happens every time
This isn't the last you've seen of me
Now that your soul is mineThe way they look at me
Can't figure out who I am
You kill yourself for them
But in the end no one cares nobody gives a damn
That's where we go
We row you row
Your soul only goesdown
Waitup
Wait
They won't look out for you
I knew that right from the start
There is nothing you can do
When you see your suburban world just falling apartIf you could see this other world what would you feel
I'll always see that look in their eyes
It's time to go
I tried to live a better life nightmares are real
And no one sees that look in my eyes
It's time to go
It seems like I've been here before
Now I can see it
And now I know that look in their eyes
It's time to go
They don't see the loss and they don't see the suffering
They don't see the pain and the anger that's in my eyes
What they do see is the damage that they've done to me
They all just stand there and laugh while they watch me die
They all just stand there and laugh while they watch me dieScratch his face make him understand
Knock her on the ground make her understand
What is that you hear Language you hold dear
You are naturally  moving
Moving toward the  hive mind
Wave thought versus  sickly words
Silence versus  breath of myth
Talk speak laugh cry yell tell scream die
Never work so scratch touch smash no
Can there be no strength in you to change the future path you're on
The broadcast minds of your new queen will tame you train you enslave you
Make you drone and drone and drone
You must LEAVE Sovereign state of mind There is no queen in the territory of
My mind is MINE Sovereign individual state
Work work obey obey sell your soul to the queen mother 
You must you must feed the hive to stay alive you must strive and strive
Obey No Obey No
Our languages are pretty cages Inlaid with gold ten thousand years old
Per chance you might escape asylum be your mate
We are naturally  moving
Moving toward the  hive mind
Wave thought versus  sickly words
Silence versus  breath of mythJe Deteste La Guerre 
Bienvenue La Mort 
Je n'aime pas ma vie 
Je Deteste La Guerre 
Il est mort de nous 
Bienvenue La Mort 
Je Deteste La Guerre 
Je Deteste La Mort 
That's enough
And to the death of us
To the death of us
Is this all there is
Is this all we get
And the rest of us
Is this all there isWhy do you hate your life so much
Mr Malcontent
You can hate your life
But don't hate mine
I don't like you
I will never come to your defense
I am not your friend
And that's just fine
You think you're someone
No one ever really cared about you
You just want someone
To think of you and make it all about you

Nothing makes you happy does it
Mr Malcontent
Do us all a favor and end your life
No one wants to follow you
Into your descent
We'll just look at you and wave goodbye
Everywhere you go they call you Mr Malcontent
No one wants you here go somewhere else
No one gives a damn about you Mr Malcontent
Mr Malcontent go fuck yourselfI am the jester of Chester lane
And I'm here to entertain you
All of my fishes are here to play
And they're here just to engage you
I am the Wickerman
I am the Wickerman
I'm not a wicked man
But I'll do what I can
To please you friends
I am the son of a paper man
But I'm not here to restrain you
Tell all the guys that it's time for fun
And I'm here to entertain you
Repeat chorus
Repeat chorusYou can't rely on just your own intuition
You've got to learn the ways of the world
It's just what you wanted you've made your decision
It looks like you'll be leaving again
And like I I I said quit fucking with my head
Now go and fuck with somebody else
You know you can't survive just on ambition
You've got to earn your wage in this world
You wanted this now go out and play
Cause tonight you'll end up somebody's whoreWhen your lights start dimming do you feel despair
You can hear us calling but you don't know where
Don't you want to be with us
And we have room for you
Just go back to bed now
Cause we know what to do
Ahhhhh
There is something down there
Don't you care what I say
I can hear them calling Can you come out and play
We want you here with us
And there's so much to see
And we can make you happy
And we can set you free
Ahhhhhhhh
We are in control now and you have lost your say
You will be like us now and now you're on your way
So your old life has ended and we have plans for you
Take a final look now before your life is through
AhhhhhhI should end my life
I'm afraid of you
Why can't I burn
I'm afraid of you
And you will burn for all of your sins
I can't get out if you can't get in
You hurt me sir
I'm afraid of you
And if I burn I will burn with you
I can't get out what am I going to do
They'll find me here
I am afraid of you
I don't mind
I don't feel it
I don't mind
Cause I need it
I don't want to die all because of you
The less they know means the more you do
You have no soul everyone knows you
Just let me go
I am afraid of youI think I killed someone
It might be because I cared too much
You can't hear what I say
Why
Is That You That I See 
Why do you feel so cold
Wake up my dear
Please don't be afraid
I'll be good to you
I promise
We'll start a family
Why won't you answer me
Don't make me mad
You did this to youHeard it all before
That was long ago
Always seems the same
I don't really care
And I don't want to fight and I don't want to cry
You can't see the reason
If you're covering up your eyes though it's not the same
So now where do you want to go
Cause there's no place to hide
You can't see the reason
If you're covering up your eyes though it's not the same
See it in their eyes
Don't they know it's wrong
I've seen it all before
But that was long ago
And I don't want to see just what in the hell is going on
You can't see the reason cause you're never in your eyes
Though it's not the same
And I want to talk to god but he's busy fighting wars
You can't start a nation if you don't have enough bombs to rule the world
Prey Together finding a way 
Prey Together It happens once just once
When our worlds collide
And you're forced to confront one another
Who exactly is in charge here now
Is it the moneychangers the wolves or is it you my brother
We're all SPECTRES we are phantoms and we are the minions
So we get screwed while they make the millions
Can I have another serving of dignity sir
I bow down before you and it is you that I serve
Now go with the others and do as you're told
You don't belong to this and may I be so bold
As to say it's been a pleasure doing business with you
But know this I'm the hunter but I don't hunt for you
I work hard for my money and I don't give it away
Do us all a big favor and come back some other day
Or how about never Because you're not welcome here
So I'll go about my business and I'll see you next yearWhat's it going to be like when they take you home
Will they be disgusted
No one wants to know of your big mistake
See their disappointment
That is why I am here
To make sure that you don't feel
Like you've done something wrong
I am here to protect you
What's it going to be when you can't leave home
Cause you'll make them worry
Better think again if you want to go
Because I won't let you
That is why I am here
To make sure you leave this life
Come to me and you'll see I will make this easy
Why live this lie
When I feel that it's just not worth it
I've had enough of this life
Will you help me end itI noticed last night something didn't seem right
A man shows up and tells me I'm wrong
And disappears in the night
I came to you to bargain for your soul
I could have picked anyone but it's yours that I know
Cause it's ripe and you know it's wrong
You seem to know what I like
I like it I like it I like it
The positions here have all been filled at times I can't believe my eyes
It's what you sow it's what you steal still come away without a prize
And now it seems so real
The pain I'm suffering it's like it's not me
But what it feels like it's like I've gone away
They take a part of your soul as they're scraping the rest away
It all comes down to one thing
It's nice to know
You'll waste away
No one listens to what I say
I want the world I want my way
No one listens to what I say
At allWhy do you run so far away
Why did you come here
Why don't you just run away
What do you need here
So I
I'm happy that you're here
So I
I'm happy that you're here
So I
This is all I have
I feel wanted here
This is all I have
Why did you just go away
Didn't you like it here
Nothing here for you to stay
We all miss you hereI don't need your misery
I don't need your apathy
Zealot
As I watch your cities burn
In the end what did you learn
Zealot
Was I wrong to make you sin
And corrupt the heart within
Live your life the way you want
Live your life the way you want
I don't need your charity
I just want your sympathy
Zealot
As I watch your rivers churn
In the end the tide will turn
Zealot
Was I wrong to make you sin
And corrupt the heart within
Live your life the way you want
Live your life the way you wantExpect your life for free decisions in your hands
You want too much from me I'll help you if I can
Save me
The war has just begun
Together we are strong
Save me save me
The tension in your words are written in the sand
There is no one left to serve to carry out your plans
You sacrificed your son you fought for useless land
You are the Chosen Ones or can't you see that
Refuse to fight for me submit to your demands
Is that what you believe Is that your final stand
Save me
The tension in your words are written in the sand
There is no one left to serve to carry out your plans
You sacrificed our sons you fought for useless land
You are the Chosen Ones Or can't you see that
The tension in our world is wringing from your hands
There is no one left to serve to fuck up all our plans
You sacrificed your sons you fought for useless land
You are the Chosen Ones
Or can't you see that
Save mePlease god forgive me
But I don't want to fight anymore
I've just been watching my life waste away
Now that you've lost your way
And I don't think that you're going back
Keeping you helpless keeps me around
And when I'm holding you in my arms
And you're feeling all is lost
Take what you want take what you want
Please god forgive me
But I don't want to live anymore
Now I'm just watching my life waste away
Hey Motherfucker Well you just can't get out when you want
Keeping your promise keeps me alive
And when I'm holding you in my arms
And you're feeling all is lost
Take what you want take what you wantWhat were you thinking Why didn't you show
Do you need to be reminded
Where were you going
Why did you go
I don't need to be reminded
Where is your religion
Where is your faith
Did you leave it far behind
Why weren't you worried
Why did you go
We all know that it's all right
Why are you busy Why didn't you go
Do you need to be alone with me
Where are you going Why won't it show
You don't know that it's beside me
Where is your religion
Where is your faith
Did you leave it far behind
Why weren't you worried
Why didn't you go
We all know that it's all right
Don't leave
Bye
StaySomebody give me a reason why these people live the way they do
They're all forced to watch the failures of their lives
They do everything that they're told as long as they're left alone
But they all seem so happy with their hands tied behind their backs
I can't understand why they care so little for each other
We don't know why they're so numb to the rest of the world
They might regret their present life and other things there before them
They can't explain the anxiety that fills their lives
Their lives fills their lives their lives
Why do we let them do as they please
You'd think that they owned our souls
Let's pray that they don't get together and change our minds
There's no use there's just no place to hide no place to go
They prey on the weak and the hungry the rich and the poor
I can't understand why they care so little for each other
We don't know why they're so numb to the rest of the world
They might regret their present life and other things there before them
They can't explain the anxiety that fills their lives
Their lives fills their lives their livesWhat happens when we just stop caring
What happens when we start to feel the same
The big surprise you've joined the masses
You look around there's no one left to blame
Time is Running Out Times are changing
Time is Running Out
Don't worry about what they think they can't think any way
They're going to live and die the way they are
It's all fault we let it happen
We tried to get you all to understand
Now it's too late to really change things
We've got to realize now just where we stand
Repeat chorus 
You never know we just might change things
If I were you I wouldn't hold my breath
You promised us you'd make things better
You've got us living in a brave new world
Repeat chorus It's cold and dark in this desolate world
It crumbles before my eyes
Last destruction by the know it all's
And now the end is near
Lead us all lead us all into The Final Conflict
Make me feel make me realize just where we went wrong
Let me learn teach me things that no one can understand
Lead us all lead us all into The Final Conflict
The sky turns red like the blood on my hands
We live in a world that's gone
We tried our best to keep it alive
But no one caredEach time I fight the battle they've won again
And I know there is no use in denying they just can't win
Oh won't they bring my soul
And they see that there is troubled waters they move they cry
And they see this is no tomorrow and they decide
Lord have mercy on my soul
And they stand there and ask me these questions
What do I know
And they see this is just no denying
They just can't go
Lord have mercy on my soulYou said last night that it's all over
You chewed me up and spit me out
Just like some gum left on the sidewalk
I'm getting stepped on I'm getting stepped on
I've seen you once since last December
I asked you how your life has been going
You're not the one that I remember
You're so much different you're much too different
You've changed
You've changed
You ask me how my life's been going
I told you once to shut your mouth
These fucking walls they're falling on me
Somebody help me somebody help meIt must have broke your poor little heart
When the boys used to say
You looked better in the dark
Oooh but now they'd give all they learnt in school
To be somewhere in the dark with you 
You know the teacher would ask the questions
And you would always raise your hand
Oooh but somehow you never got your turn
And my eyes would fill with water inside I'd burn 

Homely girl She was so lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh yes lonely girl
Homely girl you used to be lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh yeah
There was a boy who used to sit beside you
Who'd like to hold that place his whole life through
Oooh you were beautiful to me
You had a heart no one could ever see oh yes you did
I was the only one who offered
To carry your books
Took all the stares and laughter
With the dirty looks
But I saw then what they see now
They all want to ask you for a date
They don't know how they don't know how

Homely girl She was so lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh yes lonely girl
Homely girl you used to be lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh yeah
Oooh first they want a chance to hold you
Then they want a chance to try to control you
Oh no don't you know I got to say itSeems to be a misunderstanding
Bout who you belong to
I'm tired of he saying she saying

I was happy as a lark
But now I go for walks
To the movies maybe to the park
I have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play huh
You know tomorrow is their future
But for me just another day
They all gather 'round me huh
They seem to know my name
We laugh tell a few jokes
But it still doesn't ease my pain
I know I can't hide from a memory
Though day after day I've tried
I keep sayin' she'll be back
But today again I've lied
Oh I see her face everywhere I go
On the street and even at the picture show
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her
Oh I hear her voice as the cold winds blow
In the sweet music on my radio
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her
Why oh why
Did she have to leave and go away
I've been used to havin' someone to lean on
And I'm lost baby I'm lost
Oh doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her 
Oh doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her 
Oh she left her kiss upon my lips
But left that break within my heart
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her
Oh I see her hand reaching out to me
Only she can set me free
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her
Why oh why
Did she have to leave and go away
I've been used to havin' someone to lean on
And I'm lost baby I'm lost
Oh doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her 
As another day comes to an end
I'm lookin' for a letter or somethin'
Anything that she would send
With all the people I know hmm
I'm still a lonely man
You know it's funny
I thought I had her in the palm of my hand

Tell me have you seen her 
Oh doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Playin' around and connivin'
Undesired tears I was cryin'
Cause sugar coated lies I was buyin'
I was just a backseat driver in a car of love
Goin' wherever you take me
Don't know why I put up with the pain
Cause nobody else could make me
You got me goin' 
You got me goin' Hey hey 
You got me goin' 
You got me goin' Hey hey 
When you led me to the water I drank it

There's some people up there hoggin' everything
Tellin' lies givin' alibis about the peoples money an' things
An' if they gonna throw it away might as well give some to me
Yeah they seen an' heard it but never had misery
There are some people who are starvin' to death
Never knew but only heard 'em an' they never had happiness
If you don't have enough to eat how can you think of love
You don't have time to care so it's crime you're guilty of
For God's sake you got to give more power to the people
For God's sake why don't you give more power to the people
Cut this jive an' see who's got the power to kill the most
When they run out of power the world's gonna be a ghost
They know we're not satisfied so we begin to holler
They give us a promise an' throw in a few more dollars
There's no price for happiness there's no price for love
Up goes the price of livin' an' you're right back where you was
So whatever you got just be glad you got it
Now we're gonna get on up an' get some more of it
For God's sake you got to give more power to the people
For God's sake why don't you give more power to the people
For God's sake you got to give more power to the people
For God's sake why don't you give more power to the people

I'll pretend it's a special delivery
And just to give me a hint
I'll use your favorite color
Smear it with your favorite scent
Huh I know you think that I'm crazy
But I can't loose what have I left
So I've decided to write this letter
And send it to myself
So to make my story short
In the mail box I will place
This letter that I wrote
And it's stamped with your lovely face
When I'm alone
And I need someone to talk to
I talk to your picture
Get me a pencil and paper 
And write all the things
Say all the things
I've heard you say before
But with a little extra

Sugar and spice
I guess it makes me feel kind of nice
I write a letter to myself

Men are running from land to land
Trying to make things all right
Holding meeting after meeting
Constantly reaching for what
They may be thinking is right
Everybody has a plan
Ain't that just a man
People can't you understand
We gotta tell 'em

There will never be any peace
Until God is seated
At the conference table

There will never be any peace
Until God is seated
At the conference table

But when only the dark
Has come to night
Tell me who's to blame
And what's his name
You can point your finger
But you gotta remember
What was done
Was done by a man
So we gotta tell 'em

Ooh ooh

There will never be any peace
Until God is seated
At the conference table

Down on your knees
There will never be any peace
Until God is seated
At the conference table

There will never be any peace
 until God
Until He's seated
At the conference table

There will never be any peace
Until God 
Everybody there will never be any peace
Until God 
There will never be any peace

He's at the conference tableThe world today is in so many pieces
People searching for so many ways
Of releasing their disappointments and fears
So come on with the pills and the tears
We need order we need order
Yeah hey we need order
We need order hey hey
Oh the flowers and the trees
Those that are left are so very beautiful
Oh the birds and the bees
Have been forgotten almost a used to be
Man is tempted to take
If not for himself then for his children
But they can't help themselves
But rely on a prayer and a little religion
We're hung up on the knowledge of war
Something that most of us have never seen
But how sweet it would be to wake up in the morning
And find it was all a dream
We need order we need order
Hey hey we need order
We need order hey hey
We need order hey
Oh the flowers and the trees
Those that are left are so very beautiful
Oh the birds and the bees
Have been forgotten almost a used to beHe's worth more
Than every star in the sky
With that look of forgiveness
That's always in his eyes
He works so hard
But gentle as a lamb
He gave up so much
To make me just what I am and oh
Oh let me be
The man my daddy was
Oh let me be
The man my daddy was
When I was young
Sometimes foolishly I played
But he reached out and oh
Showed me the way
Now he's only human
And bound to make mistakes
But it was all right
By the moment I would awake and oh
Oh let me be
The man my daddy was
Oh let me be
The man my daddy was
Sometimes I hope
I don't live to see the day
When he reaches down
And take them both away
And look at my children
Sometimes foolishly they play
Let me live long enough
Let me show them the way
My clothes were sometimes untidy
And that bed was never made
But mom and dad would scold me good
Never doubted I've made the grade
But now that I'm a man
I ask the Lord up above
Please let me raise my children right
And be the man my daddy was and oh
Oh let me be
The man my daddy was
Oh let me be
The man my daddy was
He was a good man
He was a poor man
Oh let me beWoo the joint was a jumpin' on the corner
Down on a honky tonk street
When all of a sudden up drove a Cadillac
And out stepped a cat named Pete
Diamonds on a every finger
Wore the tailor made suit
He smoked a black cigar
He wore a stetson hat he wore a pair of cowboy boots
He busted on through the doorway
Bad as a he can be
Pulled out his pistol he turned around
He said 'my name is a big boy Pete'
The music stopped there wasn't a sound
Over in a corner stood a bad man Brown
Brown smiled and grinned he said
My friend come three steps farther and I'll a do you in
Now Pete said a look a here buddy
Before I tan your hide
I got a forty five that keeps me alive
And seven bullets on my side
Brown pulled a knife he jumped on Pete
They fought from the counter right a out to the street
They swung from north they swung from south
Brown cut that black cigar right outta Pete's mouth
Brown slipped around behind boy Pete
Cut him from his head right on down to his feet
Pete hit the ground he yelled and screamed
Pete took his stetson hat an beat the scene
Now if you ever down on the corner
Down on a honky tonk street
Don't mess with Brown he'll cut you down
Take a lesson from a big boy Pete wowAll we wanna do all we wanna do

There's nothing left here for me for you for us with them
So let's jump ship and leave seeking lands lost across the sea There's nothing left here for me for you for us with them

And there was no promise of ships to come
And there was no warning that ships would come
So we stand in hope that ships will come
And we stand in fear that ships won't come

Throw your hands in the air right now man
Feel this shit right here Scott Storch nigga
Yeah Khalid I see you nigga
Show Big Pun love uh yeah uh yo
I don't give a fuck about your faults or mis happens nigga
We from the Bronx New York shit happens
Kids clappin' love to spark the place
Half the niggaz in the squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mill for the charm nigga this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the buildin' Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit they still figure me bad
As a young n' was too much to cope with
Why you think mu'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit
Shoulda been called Armed Robbery
Extortion or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long I knew me and my peoples was gonna bubble
Came out the gate on some Flow Joe shit
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo kid
Said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the Rockaway now lean back lean back lean back lean back
I said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the Rockaway now lean back lean back lean back lean back

R to the Ezzy M to the Yzzy
My arms stay breezy the Don stay flizzy
Got a date at 8 I'm in the 74fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride till I die
With a matchin' jacket 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggaz in the club but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta and gangstas don't dance with boogies
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless check it
Said he liked my necklace started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See 'Money Ain't A Thing' nigga we still the same niggaz
Flows just changed now we 'bout to change the game nigga
Said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the Rockaway now lean back lean back lean back lean back
I said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the Rockaway now lean back lean back lean back lean back

Now we living better now Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See niggaz get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 50 boy come then they'd proudly squeal
'Cause half these rappers they 'Blow' like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line damn right I'm gonna hurt ya
These fagot niggaz even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about the Rucker
Matter of fact I don't wanna speak about the Rucker
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggaz didn't have to play to win the championship come on
Niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the Rockaway now lean back lean back lean back lean back
I said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the Rockaway now lean back lean back lean back lean back

Holding hands making all kinds of plans
While the jukebox plays our favorite song
Me and Mrs Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones got a thing going on we both know that it's wrong

Mrs Jones got a thing going on we both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it cool down now

A million thoughts run cross my mind
When I try to do without you
All I do is dream about you
And my mind
Just drifts away 
Right into the ocean of thoughts
And dreams

I go by the sea at night
To watch the moon reflect the night

I see your face in every tide
This emptiness I cannot hide
And my mind
Just drifts away 
Right into the ocean of thoughts
And dreams
Oh I want to dream on
Dream on
Drifting right on away
Like dust upon a pretty rose
It hides the beauty of my love
My love is here but then you're there
Why did our love had to pass
Oh my mind 
Just drifts 
Away 
Drifting all away girl
Right into the Ocean of Thoughts and Dreams
Oh my mind keeps on drifting
Oh it keeps on drifting away
And know I do is keep dreaming of you
And know
I'm down by the ocean
And I see your face in every tide
I keep hoping and hoping
Oh I wish you
I wish we can do it againStop that disco music

Oh a shot rings out another Mother's child is fallen
Never will her life be the same
The streets are filled with anger and with heartbreak
People trying to ease the pain
There was a time we could walk the street with some peace of mind 
Oh but this wicked shade our city
People saying it's a Pity
We all got a price to pay
Chorus
We got to leave the guns at home
We can't make in this world alone 
We got to leave the guns at home
We can't make in this world alone
We got to leave
The time has come to play the game of violence
All around the world it's the same 
Why can't we see
We all got to share the responsibility
We all the blame
There was a time we could walk the street with some peace of mind
Oh not today
We got to fight the fears that seize us
Make them a believe us
We all in this together
And we all got to take a stand
Chorus
We got to leave the guns at home
We can't make in this world alone
We got to leave the guns at home
Knowing we can't win this prize aloneSpending my day thinkin' 'bout you girl

And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong and weak from strong
That's a lot to learn but what can I give you in return
If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart 'To Sir With Love'
Those schoolgirl days of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind I know they will still live on and on
But how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to perfume
It isn't easy but I'll try
If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high 'To Sir With Love'Silent night

But man she's alright with meI find my way through the five o'clock rush hour
As daylight slowly leaves the sky
I open the door to that little room
That we call home

Her loving arms are there to greet me
Her tender lips are there to meet me
At the end of the day
You know it's always been that way

And then I find my way through the early morning traffic
But someone else is heavy heavy on my mind
I open the door to our favorite little coffee shop 
The girl is right on time now 
Her loving arms are there to greet me
Her tender lips are there always there to meet me
And that's how I start my day
It's just too bad it doesn't end that way

One women's making my home

The other girl is making me do wrong
I didn't mean to let it get that strong no baby
I got to decide where I belong

Sometimes I get so mixed up inside

I wish I could find a place to hide

I didn't mean to let it get that strong no girl
I got to decide where I belong

There's no one in life quite like you you baby
There's no one in life quite like you you baby
As I sit and wonder baby
How you do the things you do yeah
I know deep down in my heart
I'll never see all the way through no
I smile when I'm glad
You're the best thing that I ever had

One more thing
Smoke stacks signal your love
Coming from my window pane
The love I need from you baby
To take you in my arms again
One smile from you is all I need
To see me through my days

One word from you is all I need
One one one kiss from you always set me free

Like you like you early in the morning hey
Smile on your face fade in the midnight hour
No one can take your place
Even sashesNearer nearer
The minister was preaching
And the crowd was standing near
The congregation sang in a tune
In the hall it was loud and clear
All of the crowd that stood all around him
They were crying as I could plainly see
Oh the songs that they sang was so touching
They were singing to my God to Thee
Nearer my God to thee
Nearer to Thee nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee nearer to Thee
Kept on singing
Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee nearer to Thee
Sometimes I like to be in company
But when I get out I like to stay out for long
Song is the only thing that can control me Lord
When I know trouble trouble's about to come
I fall down on my knees and call God late at night
And I know He'll make my my burdens alright
I tell him Lord I have a desire to be
Nearer nearer my God to Thee Alleluia
Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee nearer to Thee
Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee nearer to Thee
I remember I was a little boy
Mother still used to 
I used to wonder what my mother was doing have mercy Lord
I stepped out one morning found mother all folded up
And mother had to rise up she was looking towards the sky
And I saw the tears as they fell down my mothers eyes
And I can still hear the song mother was singing
Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee nearer to Thee
Nearer to TheeI can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow but I was never told about the sorrow
And how can you mend a broken heart
How can you stop the rain from falling down
How can you stop the sun from shining
What makes the world go round
How can you mend a this broken man
How can a loser ever win
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow no one said a word about the sorrow
And how can you mend a broken heart
How can you stop the rain from falling down
How can you stop the sun from shining
What makes the world go round
How can you mend this broken man
How can a loser ever win
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live againLook at the morning sun shining so brightly
Love is in the air I don't care
Look at the smiling faces
Makes me know that no one can take your place your place your place
Love is the morning sun shining so brightly
It's me that's missing your love now
All the skies are grey now messing up my day
I'd never leave you in this leave oh no never never
Throwing up my hands not being a man
Don't you know that's not going to pay
Love is the morning sun shining so brightly
It's me that's missing your love now
I'm tired of being alone bye

Love is a walk down Main street 
Love is an apple that is so sweet 
Love is something that can't be beat

It's all in the heavens can't you see
You can always depend on me
To give you love
Love is a flower in my soul 
Love is a story that just can't be told 
Can't you feel it burning more and more 
Stop and look at the big wheel roll
I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
I would give my life for the glory
Just to be able to tell the story
About love
I didn't mean to make you mad
A sweet story I thought I had
But maybe time will bring us together
And I can be such a happy fella
About love
Love is something that is so divine 
Love is a feeling that's a friend of mine

snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
we're happy tonight
walking in a winter wonderland
gone away is the bluebird
here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
as we go along
walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say Are you married
we'll say No man
But you can do the job
when you're in town
Later on
we'll conspire
as we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
the plans that we've made
walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
and pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
until the alligators knock him down
when it snows
ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play
the Eskimo way
walking in a winter wonderland
walking in a winter wonderlandGod blessed our love
Even in the mornin' when I rise
I say God blessed our love
And every mornin' when I rise
I can just see heaven your eyes
It makes me know this is not an everyday love no no
We've got something I'm sure we can be proud of
Oh we've got so much show much love
We've got so much so much trust
Can't you see a halo a halo
I can see a halo hovering over us
And oh I didn't meant it baby
But God blessed our love

Kissing me now oh oh oh oh oh
Come closer to me baby hear me knowYou you drive away from me
And I wait I wait for you
Daydreaming of the way we
Ought to be
It takes it out of me
Cuz it's been long baby
It's been too long
And I wish you that you were driving home
But you you drive away from me
You you say those things I wanna hear
I like them in my ear
And I don't care where you go
Or what you said
I want you in my bed
But the distance baby it makes me sad
And I'm missing what we never had
And you you drive away from me
Ohso long my love
Ohso long so longlove
You you say that's how it is for us
Our inconvenient lust
Well I got things to do
I gotta go won't wait around no more
Cuz it's been long baby
It's been too long
And I wish that you were driving home
But you you drive away from me
I like it at the very start
Didn't think you could get to my heart
And I don't wanna let it show
But it kills me baby to watch
You goBells will be ringing the glad glad news
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again
Choirs will be singing Silent Night
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas by New Year's Night
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
Because it's Christmastime my dear
The time of year to be with the one you love
Dear won't you tell me you'll never go wrong
Christmas and New Year's will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow no grief and no pain
'Cause I'll be happy happy once again
Mmmmm no more sorrow no grief and no pain
'Cause I'll be happy Christmas once againSo I'm staring at the bed where I kissed her goodnight
Back four days ago when the whole world felt right
It's got me feeling so low
Now she's headed back down to the sunshine state
The very same place that destroyed what I created
It's got me feeling so low
It's got me feeling all alone tonight
Can't fight this feeling no
Now they say it must go wrong before it goes right
But it seems the right just never caught his flight
Yeah it's got me feeling so low
Now I'm praying to a god I don't know even exists
Hoping he can somehow just get me through this
It's got me feeling so low
It's got me feeling all alone tonight
Hold on kid the best has yet to comeI've got this terrible feeling in my head
I've got this terrible feeling in my chest
She said don't wait up for meI've got these plans can't seem to follow through with them
I've got these hands where everything falls out I'll pretend
That I've got all this figured out and I found the cure for feeling down
Remind me not to look away when I say
That things are alright but you know that I'm such a bad liar
You think I haven't figured you out cause I know what you're all about
Should this be it would it be for the better
To call it off now before it gets any deeper
I've got this terrible feeling that it won't be long
Please prove me wrong
It's been too long
I'm just another face in the crowd
Another person you never cared about
It's been too long
You think I haven't figured you out
Cause I know what you're all about
I guess this is it and it'll be for the better
We'll call it off now before it gets any deeperSo goodbye goodbye LI
I'll see you another time it's just that
These six strings say that it's time to go
And this time well be gone for more than the weekend
The way that were moving there's no time for thinking
Dear mother I thought that you should know
That I'm never coming home
Cross your fingers well get there and back
No matter what they say well find our way across the map
Coast to coast
Hold on kid the best has yet to come
Were not wasting our time were doing what we love
It's what we loveI've got this sinking feeling
Despite how empty I feel inside
And although my world has ended
I'll somehow make it out alive
Oh I cant believe this is happening
But it was clear as day to see this coming
I watched it go on and on but never thought a thing
All the weight in the world couldn't keep me down
You can't stop a believer
Cause even when the worst of the worst has come for us
We won't go down tonight
Not without a fight
I've got this hopeful feeling
Despite how useless I feel inside
And although this has all ended
It's always on mind
So as you like to my face try your best not to stutter
I'm not burning a bridge I'm just building another
We're moving on yeah we're moving on
Cause giving ups not moving onWe're broken down we're nowhere bound
I'm sorry Newport News we won't be seeing you around
We're twenty two and a half hours south from home
Now there's nowhere else there's nowhere left to go
We're stranded in the sunshine state
But we'll find a way to get through the day
Just know that everythings okay
We've landed in this long heated debate
But we'll be just fine nothings on my mind
I'm just glad that we made it out alive
What the hell were we thinking
Lucks never been a good friend
So why do we depend on him
He always seems to screw us over in the endThese restless eyes refuse to wake
They're sick of the choices that I make
The ones that end with fingers crossed
Results in missing what I've lost
Forbidden word I refuse to say
I admit I feel you everyday
This stupid game you insist to play
Why do I put up with you anyway
Well here's to change
Cause I don't wanna write sad songs anymore
Your disappointment won't bring me down
And some might say it killed me but I kind of think it saved me
You destroyed all I created and left me for dead
So I build myself up and now I'm something and you just mean nothingAquarius Libra Leo Cancer

Hurry up and wait
So close but so far away
Everything that you've always dreamed of
Close enough for you to taste
But you just can't touch
You wanna show the world
But no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where
And how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting
We live and we learn to take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen and it's
Supposed to happen and we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time
You believe and you doubt
You're confused you got it all figured out
Everything that you always wished for
Could be yours should be yours would be yours
If they only knew
You wanna show the world
But no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where
And how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting
We live and we learn to take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen and it's
Supposed to happen and we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time
When you can't wait any longer
But there's no end in sight
When you need to find the strength
It's your faith that makes you stronger
The only way you get there
Is one step at a time
We live and we learn to take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen and it's
Supposed to happen and we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time
We live and we learn to take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen and it's
Supposed to happen and we
Find the reasons why
One step at a timeNo stronger love

You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you and now you've gone away
Don't you see that now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
That I have to follow you and beg you to come home
You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever I will understand
Believe me believe me I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and quite unreal
All that's left is loneliness there's nothing left to feel
You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand believe me believe me
You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand believe me believe meGirl if your heart is broken beyond repair
Pick up the pieces and say a little prayer

And you need someone to hold your hand

And I bet you get the one who loves you
Hey baby I bet you get the one that needs you girl
I bet you get the one who loves you Lord
Girl now can't you see

That I wanna be your loving man
I bet you get the one that loves you

I bet you get the one
I bet you get the one
I bet you get the one

It's all about youSo you'll take this all away if I promise not to say a thing
It's been a long time since I've seen the ground
It's been a long time since I've gotten down with you
Take off your coat take off your shoes
We'll drive away these winter blues that I could live in
I should've known that someday you would give in
I've been writing all day trying to come up with the right words to say
that I don't hate you I just don't want anything to do with you
Come on you know you get it you can't be that nave
Don't hit me up three months later asking for reprieve
Before I jump off this roof wont you tell me what for
Before I cut any deeper doctor hit me with the cure
I've got a good reason for calling you out
This ain't a game
So drop the act let me go on
I've been up all night
So drop the act let me go on
I could go all night
Take off your coat take off your shoes
We'll drive away these winter blues that I could live in
I should've known
Before I jump off this roof wont you tell me what for
Before I cut any deeper doctor hit me with the cure
I'm spinning my tires now and going nowhere
You say spread your love elsewhere
I've got tons to spare
So drop the act let me go on
I've been up all night
So drop the act let me go on
I could go all night
And to think through all of this I thought I knew you
And to think through all of this I never knew you
Let me go on let me go on
I've been up all night I've been up all night
So drop the act let me go on
I've been up all night
So drop the act let me go on
I could go all nightDrink caffeine to keep your heart beating
You're the saddest thing I've ever seen
I picked you out of my teeth and I've got damn good reason
Stale friends thrown out with eggs and bread
Bad friends go out with glory
Dead friends go out just go out
Veins splitting bone chest ringing with tone
I'll sing the song that'll take you home
You'll be alright alone
Just hear the sound I hope you're proud
Beat yourself down from the inside out
You would be lost without me
Anchors aweigh my friend
Anchors aweigh
But the ivory casing on the keys
They don't know why you have to leave
But they sing about it best
Another sad song just like the rest
Talk your way out of this one boy
Make no mistake your every word has been wasted
Veins splitting bone chest ringing with tone
I'll sing the song that'll take you home
You'll be alright alone
Just hear the sound I hope you're proud
Beat yourself down from the inside out
You'll be alright without me
I haven't seen you in so long
It feels like I haven't seen the sun
You told me you'd be there I guess that you lie
You're more than meets the eye a whore in disguise
Why would I forgive you Now exit stage right
I hope this is goodbye
Veins splitting bone chest ringing with tone
I'll sing the song that'll take you home
You'll be alright alone
Just hear the sound I hope you're proud
Beat yourself down from the inside out
You're better off without me
You're better off without me
Anchors aweigh my friend
I never want to trace this back
And let the record show  I'm happy once againI can't wait forever though I wish I could
Put my name next to forever like you said you would
But I can't stop these thoughts from freaking me out and I've never felt like this
Fuck I'm scared we'll never get out of here
Well aware that everything happens for a reason
Still haven't found mine yet
And I'm flipping through these pages again
Trying to find where everything went everything went wrong
Where will I fall asleep tonight
There's the van or I could fight with three dudes and try to score the couch
Listen I believe I'm finding my way
Way out from under this shit
But I'm gonna need someone to listen up
I don't need anyone I'll do this all by myself
And don't you try to talk me down you know that never helps
I'm sick and tired of this routine bullshit it's killing me
But I'm trying to teach myself to breathe
If these last seven years have meant anything more than a few blown tires and a bad rv
I know I have the will inside me inside of me


Through all the meaningless tirades
Over earth's greatest highways
Through all the messes we made I swear this is all of me
I'm asking you honestly
Have you even looked at what you're running from
Yeah
Have you even looked
That's when you close your eyes stop screaming
So I step back inside it's easy to think the stakes have never been this high
We can't be happy where we are
Take a look yeah one good look
And tell me then what do you see inside the picture your mind took
two people with a shot at everything
that's what they would say when they would look up at you and me
we've been up yeah way up high we were the best of friends we had the best of nights
but lately I've been feeling there's a little something holding us back
what happened to the old days when I knew everything you were about to say
not every mistake you were born to make
I'm already on the next page
and we might have had a good thing but I guess in the it was never enough
bad decisions bring good divisions
Tell me I'm banking on something real
'Cause baby if it doesn't start to feel like it soon I'm fucking out of here she said
and it might make for a better story if I told you that I couldn't shake you
but even the worst times are starting to fade too like pages in my mind
that are starting to wear through
But I guess here's another song about someone not worth it all

She's doesn't want the boy in boyfriend just the man in romance
I start to think that I'll never grow up and I missed another chance

So these are the new days
When I could care less about all that you have to say
And all the mistakes you are bound to make
We were never on the same page
And we might have had a good thing but I guess in the end it was never love
Bad decisions brought good divisionsMadness hides in mistakes done over with a smile
We haven't felt each other in awhile
I'd like to put you in this song and string you along
Old flames die hard and I've never been so glad to see that face
Maybe I can't get things right
Maybe I'm the worst mistake of all time
So take a chance girl take a chance girl
Swallow down this line
And all I want is everything you've got
And all I want is everything
Remember me every time you fall asleep haunting all your dreams
You've got that style in the corners of your smile
It's good for me to chase after everything we used to be
It's going down tonight we're gonna party like it's 2009
Better say your prayers 'cause we're going all out
Going pound for pound I bring the noise like your nightmares sound
And we were born for this and we can never live it down
And all I want is everything you've got
And all I want is everything
Remember me every time you fall asleep haunting all your dreams
You've got that style in the corners of your smile
It's good for me to chase after everything we used to be
It's good for me to chase after everything we used to be
It's good for me let me pinch myself is this still happening
It's good for me to chase after everything we used to be
It's good for me you knock me out I'm still here smiling
Remember me every time you fall asleep haunting all your dreams
You've got that style in the corners of your smile
It's good for me to chase after everything we used to beLike three big steps with a loaded gun
The only thing to do is come get some
Don't like the blisters on my silver tongue
White noise keeps me sane
Why does logic end illogically
And honestly I'm crippled carrying my hearts one strength
Midnight sorrows come and go
and I've got nobody left to know
My dreams fade in and out
it feels so good to be down for the count
You strangle the sense from me
Driving me to crazy things
Your crazy bitch logic ruins everything
Six weeks in a concrete room
The camera starts to shake as we start to zoom
All this time spent forgetting time with you
White noise keeps me sane
Why does logic end illogically
And honestly I'm crippled carrying my hearts one strength
Midnight sorrows come and go
and I've got nobody left to know
My dreams fade in and out
it feels so good to be down for the count
You strangle the sense from me
Driving me to crazy things
Your crazy bitch logic ruins everything
Your smile is like a one way ticket out of here
Your eyes have looked in mine and lied for the last time
Midnight sorrows come and go
and I've got nobody left to know
My dreams fade in and out
it feels so good to be down for the count
You strangle the sense from me
Driving me to crazy things
Your crazy bitch logic ruins everythingTake a step back I get it can't say I regret it
Cause a love like that is a love that leaves
It's not enough for me
I bit off more than I can chew
My heart's been beaten black and blue
The floodgates are open and I'm coming for you
Sometimes I wanna split my head on the side of the road just to get you off my mind
But your face would look better spread across the asphalt this time
You tried to get all my friends to hate me
And I never stood my ground this is the last time you try to change me
I'm not backing down
If it's a fight that you want then you came to the right place came to the same place
I've got to get this off my chest
You know I'm better than the rest
The dark deeds on my mind won't be nearly as fun if you don't act surprised
And I won't feel better and I can't feel better
Gotta get back to where my head was at
Gotta do my best to shut my trap
I can't contain this I can't contain myself I can't contain this
No I can't contain myself
You can call me dull and broken and make fun of all my friends
But you'll never make a mistake like this 
Like this ever again
You left a note next to my nightstand just to prove that you were right like you had any clue at all
I drove all night I had to get away
I had lost the will to fight
I found the alleys of Richmond an old friend laughed and he said quietly I can get you through
the night so I gave everythingMove to the west coast
Forget your friends back home
Throw all your drama in a suitcase become unknown
Abandon the empire
That nine to five life
You've got a whole big batch of big plans and now you've got to get it right
But when that day comes to leave you'll catch sight of the ocean man it never really shines like this and I'm not scared of being alone she said
But I know her better than that
And it's the way she flips her hair in the heat of this conversation
It's saying more than the lack of her motivation
And she swears to me her only thought is to leave but it would take too many hands to count the friends that you would leave behind we took the long walk all the way from 81st street down to the boardwalk we never saw the rain roll in

California's got nothing on me
Unless you've got the guts to take back all these years
California's got werewolves and zombies
I'll fill in the blanks with anything
Anything to keep you here
What if I showed up at the airport and I had all my things packed too
What if I said I had a ticket and a seat right next to you
What if I sold all my guitars and quit the band
Man they would kill me
What if I said you made this harder than I ever thought it could be
Remember when we used to ride around the backroads of Kempsville late night just to pass the time screaming every line
Why are you afraid of being part of something real
Too afraid to call this home
Why are you afraid of being part of something real
I know you're homeAnd if you leave
You leave me with nothing
And if you stay I'm afraid I've got nothing left to say
So long as I may for these answers
Row me to the shore
Blow me a kiss but don't blow me away
Don't blow me away
And on the beach where you held me last summer
We met with the stars and danced until we were swept away
And we swam like we knew towards the current
And I begged to your face like a door
To be like the tide but not like the waves
No not like the waves
And I knew right then we were done
And I asked you with eyes like the sun have you even looked atI'm sick of what you told me of what lies on the road ahead
Big crowds big lights and the highway
One day I'm sure it's destined to end
Where do you think we're going
Our lives are intertwined
Just think about all the high times
One day I'm sure they will arrive
You'll never never never understand
Why we never got that far why we never wanted more
With the clouds in my eyes
The breath in my chest
Dear friends we were never second best
We're almost there
Not ashamed of the scene that we found in shambles
Like wreckage from a quake
We've slowly become so stagnant and I think it's more than I can take
Of them and their downward spiral
Of this end leading to a means
it's all or nothing from here on out
tomorrow night I hope will bring
big lights our time
These dreams this life

I'll bring the shotgun and you bring the bass
We'll live for this moment we'll die by our ways 
Hold hope close
Well I don't want to feel this way anymore
Like I've been washed down the drain
Straight through the pipes into the floor
And giving up is something I've always done best
Throwing years and years away
Two shots directly through the chest
but it's time for change
No more arguing no more lying eyes
I've been floundering for months
These old chords are my disguise
All's well that ends well
I've given up on the past if you couldn't tell
I don't wanna think everyone is just like him
But I could be alright admitting it
Well I don't wanna be your fair weather friend
How could you make me feel so worthless
How could you throw me off the edge of it
And even if I didn't mean to I forgot you
Rather I forgot who you were
I won't forget what you've become
Come on give me a reason
All's well that ends well
I've given up on the past if you couldn't tell
I don't wanna think everyone is just like him
But I could be alright admitting
All's well that ends well
I've given up on the past if you couldn't tell
I don't wanna think everyone is just like him
But I could be alright admitting
That I've got some problems
That I may have taken this too far
That it may have been hasty to throw this away
All's well that ends well
I've given up on the past if you couldn't tell
I don't wanna think everyone is just like him
But I could be alright admitting
All's well that ends well
I've given up on the past if you couldn't tell
I don't wanna think everyone is just like him
But I could be alright admitting itWhoa this town won't be the death of me
I put the phone down I didn't like where your words had been
Your downer style couldn't kill my smile
I admit you never win
I said I swear and I meant it this is a part of me
You won't find me crossing my fingers
Outside there's a world there's never been
I'm finding strength places that it's never been
I'm cutting off all the weights in my life that have brought me down this far
I'm feeling I feel alive in my own skin
Rebuilt anew trying to be who I used to be
Not just fighting and working just to live
but maybe making it worth it now to give what I have to give
Outside there's a world there's never been
I'm finding strength places that it's never been
I'm cutting off all the weights in my life that have brought me down this far
and I've found with a fifth of feelgood
I can navigate through seas with the darkest skies
I'm getting back to the point in my life where I meant it when I say
Whoa this town wont me the death of me
This feels much better than the first time
I feel alive and much stronger
not naive and alone
so I hope that you got what you wanted
while I ride into the sunset  sunset
Outside there's a world there's never been
I'm finding strength places that it's never been
I'm cutting off all the weights in my life that have brought me down this far
and I've found with a fifth of feelgood
I can navigate through seas with the darkest skies
I'm getting back to the point in my life where I meant it when I sayWe've been around for a long time
Thinking about this day
When all the words we have to say
Will start to matter

I've gotten off my high horse and never felt so good
To be alive from all those crazy times that
Made me who I am and who you were
Give me the chance give me the time
Give me the chance to make this mine
It's in my veins this is the time
Give me the chance
Let's go let me see you put 'em out
Right now tonight we're gonna have some fun
Just know we're taking every chance until our time has come
Let's go let me see you put 'em out
Right now tonight we're gonna have some fun
Just know we're taking every chance until our time has come
Well this ain't our first rodeo
And we've seen you come and go
Like the change of winds and tides
And fashion victims wait in line
We ain't on top but we ain't bottom
Battle scars damn right we've got 'em
Fighting the good fight on four wheels
Do you even know how good this feels
Give me the chance give me the time
Give me the chance to make this mine
It's in my veins this is the time
Give me the chance
Let's go let me see you put 'em out
Right now tonight we're gonna have some fun
Just know we're taking every chance until our time has come
Let's go let me see you put 'em out
Right now tonight we're gonna have some fun
Just know we're taking every chance until our time has come
We're gonna reach for the stars
We're gonna look past mountains
We'll hold you where you are
And you'll never forget the weekends
Let's go let me see you put 'em out
Right now tonight we're gonna have some fun
Just know we're taking every chance until our time has come
Let's go let me see you put 'em out
Right now tonight we're gonna have some fun
Just know we're taking every chance until our time has comeSome things should just be said
Some things are better left cold and dead
Sometimes you need to hold your breath and take the story to the end
All we thought we could be
All the sweetest memories
They made for a great story but now you could go on without me
Leave me alone tonight
the next six months won't make you feel like remembering how you felt when you met me
And thought this was smart it will only get harder
You'll find yourself farther down a dark twisted overgrown road
We tried to pick up pieces in the dark
But you can't really fix it if it never really worked from the start
And try as we might we'll never make it out alive
These battle scars are oh so deep
The good fight was lost to your deceit
Listen good and listen to me
this is the only way it can ever be
no way we'll ever find our way back to that day last summer

You hid your eyes from the sun and me
As I led you to where I would leave
I looked you somewhere in the face where I thought your eyes might be
We loved our city by the sea I told her
There's nothing left for you and me
Take a look and face your nightmares or you'll never stop never stop never stop running
I guess the worst is over No one has seen this love again
Faced with another dead end
One day I'll see light raise again
In the end
Making a living with guttery ends
And you fight with the lies of consequence
How much money do we owe to this end
We all must come to an end
Played it in the time
That look in your eyes
Heroes undefined
Never mind it's mine all mine
It's mine all mine
Played it in the time
The way I feel inside
Will they realise
We tried and tried and tried and tried and tried
No one will believe whats told again
It gets so old to pretend
One day I'll have my place again
Theres no end
Making a living with guttery ends
And you fight with the lies of consequence
How much money do we owe to this end
We all must come to an end
Played it in the time
That look in your eyes
Heroes undefined
Never mind it's mine all mine
It's mine all mine
Played it in the time
The way I feel inside
Will they realise
We tried and tried and tried and tried and tried
Making a living with guttery ends
And you fight with the lies of consequence
How much money do we owe to this end
We all must come to an endShaky startled erratic harmful winding twisting incessant ripping
Impending doom and it's ending soon
Making way torwards my griptape tomb
Going so fast that it's bound To end
Going down hard no matter how I shred
I know that speed kills now that I've sped
And I know that it hurts now that I'm dead
Yet another victim
To the tempting
SPEED WOBBLES
Even the greats will fall
After all
Last guy that tried to power slide died
His tale lives on but he didn't survive
Gravel on gravel death by axel
Floored by the board more pain than you can handleYou have no gain
I point the finger at you scream until my face is blue
But you still hate everything
I point the finger at you beaumonde through and through
You still hate everything
Turn the lights on watch them scatter
Exterminate the idle chatter
I point the finger at you until you're cold dead and blue
But you still hate everything
If you're right it feels good to be wrong
Raised fist and a fuck you song
If you're right it feels good to be wrong
Slaughtering the pigs
How do you sleep
Yeah how do you sleep

I point the finger at you you don't have a fucking clue
And you still hate everything
I point the finger at you doesn't matter what I do
'Cause you still hate everything
I turn the lights on I watch them scatter
Exterminate the idle chatter
I point the finger at you lie and lie until it's truth
But you still hate everything
If you're right it feels good to be wrong
Raised fist and a fuck you song
If you're right it feels good to be wrong
Slaughtering the pigs
How do you sleep
No change no shift no rest
There is no war without warriors

I point the finger at you

If you're right it feels good to be wrong
Raised fist and a fuck you song

Yeah how do you sleep
How do you sleep
And I'm telling you to plead gonna fuck itOne billion workers stand up from their chairs
Their faces no longer struck with their fears
Attack attack stabbed in the back
Disgraced disgraced traitors trade face to face
Revolution the engine of history
When all the lights go out when all the world is in doubt
When all the goods cease to move I won't be alone
When all the swords become plows when all the fields are afoul
When all the cogs cease to turn I won't be alone
Punching the clock stabbing the boss
We don't need the CEO's they need us
Attack attack outsourced for a hack
Disgraced disgraced displace and replace
Proletarians of the world unite
You have nothing to lose but your chains
When all the lights go out when all the world is in doubt
When all the goods cease to move I won't be alone
When all the swords become plows when all the fields are afoul
When all the cogs cease to turn I won't be alone
We are not numbers we are names
We won't be alone
We are not crime reports we are history
We won't be alone
We are not folklore we are culture
We won't be alone
We are not human resources we are human beings
I won't be a I won't be a we won't be alone
When all the lights go out
When all the lights go out
When all the lights go out when all the world is in doubt
When all the goods cease to move I won't be alone
When all the swords become plows when all the fields are afoul
When all the cogs cease to turn I won't be a I won't be a
We won't be aloneYou're fired
You stupid fucking piece of shit
You're fired
You're nothing but a hypocrite
You're fired
Conformist fucking chickenshit
Douse the dream in kerosene
You're fired
You only sing so phones can ring
You're fired
Here's something your phone can sing
You're fired
Fuck this fuck that fuck compromising
Watch it all fall apart
Murder the beast and feast on the heart
Watch the industry just fall apart
Off with the head and the body discardClose your eyes and shield your ears
Shut your mouth and conceal all of your fears
Greed it's not going anywhere
They should put that on a billboard in Times Square
It could say The great depression is over my friends
What we want and what we need they've engineered
I can smell the bullshit right from here
Because greed it's not going anywhere
They should put that on a billboard in Times Square
It could say The great depression is over my friends
Blinding your eyes and burning your ears
TV images are selling
Through the static on the radio you can't hear
One pill if you're too big
One pill if you're too small
On one your life is a mess
On one you're nothing at all
I hate a song that makes you think you are no good
The great depression is over my friends
I hate a song that makes you think you are just born to lose
The great depression is over my friendsHello
They've sold our their music's changed
This sold out record sounds the same
Don't criticize our hobbies
We don't criticize you for being fucking assholes
Woah woah woah woah
Teenage Kennedy lobotomy
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
The Free Mumia tent was all out of Mumias
You got any contacts I can network with

Fuck off we're not here for help
We're clearly in this for the wealth
Okay Pat
I get paid by the drum beat
Woah woah woah woah
Teenage Kennedy lobotomy
Woah woah woah woah
This is the first night of the rest of our lives
I can't help wonder how is it we're still alive
Welcome to the first night of the rest of our lives
Oh yeah and I said welcome to the first night of the rest of our lives
We stayed up all night long laughing singing in the streets
Oh yeah you know The Clash Ramones The Pogues
Our voices hoarse our bodies weak and ready for sleep
Lean against me wipe your bloodshot eyes as I wipe mine
And from these rooftops we'll watch the sun rise
Ain't this the life
Yeah it's the first night of the rest of our lives
I can't help wonder how is it we're still alive
Welcome to the first night of the rest of our lives
With just half tank of gasa hundred fifty miles to go no cash no food
We turned the engine off every time we went down hill
And it's on with the show
I don't know whether to laugh or cry
Oh no I don't
All I know is that I am alive I'm really alive
And it's the first night of the rest of our lives
I can't help wonder how is it we're still alive
Welcome to the first night of the rest of our lives
Oh yeah then I said welcome to the first night of the rest of our lives
We heard you there and jumped from the train
Ran up the tracks
All the while you screaming back kiss my ass
We're living our lives I'm livin' and yeah doin' fine
Oh yeah oh yeah I'm doing fine
And it's the first night of the rest of our lives
I can't help wonder how is it we're still alive
Welcome to the first night of the rest
Let's hope this night of lights won't be our last yeah
Welcome to the first night of the rest of our lives
Oh goodbyeIt's time to make a move
Change the times or they'll change you
False promises of more check that shit at the door
We're the ones we've been waiting for
We are the one united under none
We are the one the ones to carry on
Warfare is everywhere
Poisoned land water air
This routine is long old it's time to break that mold
We'll break it up then we'll break out
We are the one united under none
We are the one the ones to carry on
Withstand the change
Tear it down rebuild again evolve with vision
Yeah this year's eve we will breathe fury
I will scale the city walls scale
We are the one united under none
We are the one the ones to carry onThe time has come to say goodnight
The time has come to say goodbye to the old guard
Goodnight
Goodbye
Witness the setting sun
The tables have been turned
We will not suffer their reprise
A brave new voice rings out
Intense fearless devout
A listless body now revived
Old stories fit with retreads
Halftruths with truth left unsaid
Each time their lips moved we heard lies
So now it's time to say goodbye
To the old guard goodnight goodbye
To the old guard goodnight goodbye
Witness the setting sun
This century's crash and burn
Autocracy dethroned by ire commissar doused in fire
Make note a million times
Their class war deceit lies
Their compassion laced with despise
All of the hatred they bred
All the division they spread
We always knew they lived on lies
So now it's time to say goodbye
Bear witness to this setting sun
The dawning of a new age has begun
From east to west we watch this setting sun
The dawning of a new age has begun
Now it's time to say goodbyeI saw right through your eyes
I saw right through your guise
Every word that left you lips was
Just a covert disguise to hide your absent mind
You live and breathe sleep and drink
Beg and plead blind diseased
No water can wash the blood off your hands
On Independence Day
On Independence Day
Traded the Nobel Peace Prize
Exchanged for Vietnamese lives
Bombs filled the Cambodian skies
In East Timor you stood up for the wrong side
Wrong side wrong side
You live and breathe sleep and drink
Beg and plead blind diseased
No water can wash the blood off your hands
On Independence Day
On Independence Day
On Independence Day
On Independence Day
No water can wash the blood off your hands
No it can't no it can't
No water can wash the blood off your hands
No it can't no it can't
No water can wash the blood off your hands
No it can't no it can't
No water can wash the blood off your hands
No it can't no it can'tNadead for collective sin
We decide where why who and when
Build our bibles to ONLY include the things
we believe to be divine and true
This is our right
This is our life
Everyone homogenized
Sodom Gomorrah Washington DC
Smited into oblivion with blood wrath and disease
Sheep in shepherd's clothing
Yahweh Jesus Muhammad
Their words have way more in common
than than the Midwest or the Middle East like to preach
It's a tragedy
It's a strategy
To prey on contrast to not indulge fact
Divide conquer subcontract
The scriptures blind followers read are not as cryptic as they seem
The pages serve the sick and poor
not to serve the capitalists of endless war
Religion is the opiate of the weakI've seen a lot of rip offs in my life
Seen a lot of scams a lot of crooks and crooked schemes
Crooked sharks
Part one of the story reads
The liquor store thief the stick up man
Thrown into the clink never coming back yeah
Until the day he's gray and old
I seen a lot of rip offs in my life
The rip offs of the old and of the young
The weak the sick the never known
Stabbed repeatedly in the back by the Wall Street suit
The Washington hack
Lining up their pockets with the people's cash
And laughing all the way to the bank
Do you want to live your life a slave
In chains from the cradle to the grave
The economy is suffering let it die
Do you want to live your life a slave
In chains from the cradle to the grave
The economy is suffering let it die yeah
I've seen a lot of bailouts in my life
But why is it I never see a bailout
For the homeless and the poor
And while we're on the subject
I could use a few bucks for a guitar amp
A new six string and a tank of gas yeah
Everything that I want that I want
We're so fucked and we don't give a fuck no
We're so fucked but no we just don't care
'Cause we're so so fucked
This world is shit out of luck and we don't give a fuck
Do you want to live your life a slave
In chains from the cradle to the grave
The economy is suffering let it die
Do you want to live your life a slave
In chains from the cradle to the grave
The economy is suffering suffering let it die

And so the time has finally come
The bourgeoisie have signed the war decree with Prelierate blood
And that blood which flows from their pen
Is the closest that they're ever been to the people
You've been to our shows you've sung our songs
Now we are asking you to add to each chorus you've sung and
Protest against injustice state terror
On the streets of the world for the disempowered
You've sung at our shows cheered right over wrong
Now's the time to hit the streets back up the words you've sung
'cause our voices a lone this time will not get it done
Looking to stop a rouge regime
Well the first one that we must suggest is WASHINGTON DC
The Bush Terror War UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNCONSCIENABLE
We refuse to let him kill in our name for oil
We know their game know they're corrupt
It's up to hit the streets and take our country back
Protest against injustice state terror
On the streets of the world for the disempowered
You've sung at our shows cheered right over wrong
Now's the time to hit the streets back up the words you've sung
'cause our voices a lone this time will not get it done
Because united the people will indeed get it doneWe have no rights and i am pissed
the bill of rights does not exist
this whole system is a lie
This system we should defy
Class Plague 
Society the one we hate
Stop corruption it's too late
This whole system is built by the rich

Class Plague 
Society separates more and more
The rich are getting richer the poor are getting poorer
Capitalism's time to fall has come
It's time we should have revolution

Piece of Rag

Fuck the flag and fuck you
Fuck the flag and fuck you
Fuck the flag and fuck you
Fuck the flag the fucking flag fuck the flag
Fuck the flag and fuck you
Heres a flag
Take this match
Burn that fucker
I got a song stuck in my head
Walking down street number nine
I sing it out loud with my friends
And we're all having a good time
We all waited for weeks
Now we're hanging on the street in NYC
We gotta go to the show
Even though we're all underage
Outside the firehall in PA
It rained on three hundred kids all day
When the cops shut it down no one went away
We're Gonna Play No Matter What They Say
Three or four people showed up in Albuquerque
The alternator died
Somewhere between Mankato and Rapid City
Strangers in some strange lands in LA
The enchiladas made us sick but that's ok
Growing Up
We didn't want to be like them
It was tough to know
Who were our friends
Killing time playing basements
Way back when
In a lot of ways nothings changed
From now and them
Some say they have been let down
I wonder why they still hang around
I wonder where all these good things could be
Then I realize that somehow I found them in meThe world keeps turning and I keep fighting
'cause what else are you to do
When there's a fascist telling you
It's time you were put in your place
As he salutes the Stars and Stripes
By raising fists and starting fights
Like an aberration from Hitler's Nazi Riech
NOT PROUD  Of my skin
NOT PROUD  Of where I live
I'm fucking proud of who I am
National pride inside you
Building you up or limiting you
Everyone keeps asking
Why's he so pissed and so angry
When there's killing in this world
of men and womyn boys and girls
For the sake of a dividend gain
These actions proclaimed in our name
turn Stars and Stripes to shades of shame
Gifts from America With Love The USA
NOT PROUD  Of my skin
NOT PROUD  Of where I live

The president wages an endless war so he can
Justify stealing fucking billions
Steal the public's rights through the use of fear use of fear
That is a system I can not endorse
National pride inside you
Building you up or limiting you
Fighting for what on the battlefield
Humanity Corporate control and greed
Look for the truth you'll see

With the midst of anger
Mom and dad can't make sense
Of her sexual preference
It seems the car
Just drive by on this night
No one has any idea
What this feels like
You wave your flag
Tell me I'm free
Then use the word fag
To fuck with me

Hey hey a right to choose

Gender is not the issue
Judged by parents and the public
With the fingers pointed at them
Well I'll point mine right back
They must realize
You can't change whom you love
Gender is not the issue
That night she said I will be true
Meant every word she said to you

Hey hey a right to choose

Gender is not the issue
It seems today to be yourself
It takes so much courage and strength
You were half the human as people who come out
This world would be a better place
You wave your flag
Tell me I'm free
Then use the word fag
To fuck with me
Go and wave your flag
Go and wave your flag
Go and wave your flag
I'm free fucking free yeah

Hey hey a right to choose

Gender is not the issueTen easy steps to create an enemy and start a war
Listen closely because we will all see this weapon used in our lives
It can be used on a society of the most ignorant
To the most highly educated we need to see these tactics as a weapon
Against humanity and not as truth
This is how to create an enemy
This is how to start a war
This is how to create an enemy
First step
Create the enemy
Sometimes this will be done for you
Second step
Be sure the enemy you have chosen is nothing like you
Find obvious differences like race language religion
Dietary habits fashion
Emphasize that their soldiers are not doing a job
They are heartless murderers who enjoy killing
Third step
Once these differences are established
Continue to reinforce them with all disseminated information
Fourth step
Have the media broadcast only the ruling party's information
This can be done through state run media
Remember in times of conflict
All forprofit media repeats the ruling party's information
Therefore all forprofit media staterun
Fifth step
Show this enemy in actions that seem strange militant or different
Always portray the enemy as nonhuman evil a killing machine
This is how to create an enemy
This is how to start a war
This is how to create an enemy
Sixth step
Eliminate opposition to the ruling party
Create an Us versus them mentality
Leave no room for opinions in between
One that does not support all actions of the ruling party
Should be considered a traitor
Seventh step
Use nationalistic and or religious symbols
And rhetoric to define all actions
This can be achieved by slogans such as
Freedom loving people versus those who hate freedom
This can also be achieved by the use of flags
Eighth step
Align all actions with the dominant deity
It is very effective to use terms like
It is God's will or God bless our nation
Ninth step
Design propaganda to show that your soldiers have feelings
Hopes families and loved ones
Make it clear that your soldiers are doing a duty
They do not want or like to kill
Tenth step
Create and atmosphere of fear and instability
Then offer the ruling party as the only solution
To comfort the public's fears
Remembering the fear of the unknown is always the strongest fear
This is how to create an enemy
This is how to start a war
This is how to create an enemy
We are not countries we are not nations

We are not religions we are not Gods
We are not weapons we are not ammunition

We are not killers we will not be tools
Motherfuckers
I will not die I will not kill
I will not be your slave
I will not fight your battle
I will not die on your battlefield
I will not fight for your wealth
I am not a fighter
I am a human beingThe herd marches in to work
In black and white uniform
Dressed for their funeral
Nine to five viewing and burial
The CEO's wrangle 'em in
Through revolving doors
They brand on corporate logos
And remove their souls
Woah ya do what you're told
Woah woah ya what you're told
Do what you're told
At the tallest buildings on the block
On one way streets the tickers tock
Another suit is lost
One more head on the chopping block
Woah ya do what you're told
Woah woah ya do what you're told yeah
There must be more to this life
We must be worth more than our work
Who you are your job won't define

We fight they lie
'Cause if we fall for the spin they sell
We fight we die

Let the Eagle Soar
Let the Eagle SoarI want to tell you a little story
'Bout a party that went all right
But went all wrong
I want to tell you a little story
'Bout a party in this song
It happened back in '93
In the Pittsburgh punk rock scene
An event that will go down in infamy
It was all the master plan
Of one legendary punk rock kid
His name was 'Spaz' S P A Z
An eviction notice sent to his house
Sparked off an idea
I should have one last party at my place
So off he set with his master plan
The invitations in his hand read
You're invited to my house destruction party
Spaz's house destruction party
It was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough
To make the house destruction party
Then you know you're lucky that you lived
We played there St Patrick's Day
With submachine and the bad genes
In a basement full of debris
From kicked in doors broken glass
Kicked in walls the place was trashed
The house was now missing its support beams
The bathrooms had no toilets
Or sinks left in them
There was nothing
In the kitchen left to break
Aus rotten spray painted on walls
Drunk punks passed out in the halls
And this was just the second night
Or a threeday long part
Spaz's house destruction party
It was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough
To make the house destruction party
Then you know you're lucky that you lived
The cops showed up and all the kids
Went piling out the back
I remember running away and hiding out
In the lot behind the squirrel hill Mellon bank
The cop said I want to speak
To someone who lives here
And this punk kid said she did
He asked Is this the condition
This house has always been in
She answered  Ah yeah it is
Spaz's house destruction party
It was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough
To make the house destruction party
Then you know you're lucky that you livedIt's in the paper every day
I see it in the headlines and I feel so sick yeah
As another life leaves this world this world
So full of hate but short
Short on compassion
Short on humanity
Asking myself in vain shaken by the shock
Do we even have a chance
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna die
We are all human
Let's start to prove it
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna die
We are all human
Let's start to prove it
This is a plea for peace world peace
To the oppressors of the world and to
To the leaders of nations corporate profit takers
To the everyday citizen
Greed envy fear hate the competition has to stop
When you see someone down
Now's the time to pick them up
Set your differences aside never look back no
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna die
We are all human
Let's start to prove it
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna die
We are all human
Let's start to prove it
Isn't everybody tired of the fighting Hey hey
Isn't everybody tired of the killing Hey hey
Isn't everybody tired of the dying Hey hey
Isn't everybody tired of the hatred Hey hey
Violence hey hey fighting hey
Killing hey dying hey
And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow
I still have a dream we will be able to speed up that day
When all of God's children black men and white men
Jews and Gentiles Protestants and Catholics
Will be able to join hands and sing Free at last free at last

I don't want your fucking dogma
I don't believe in what you preach
I don't want your fucking bullshit
You infect everyone you teach
You offer prepacked salvation
For the guilty chosen few
You say we're all just sinners
Say it to the altar boy you screw
You make me sick with what you do
Lies and guilt and hate are what you spew
You do it over and over and over again
Take your god and shove it up your ass
Ignoring real problems
That you've hidden in denial
Living in the past
Ruining people's lives
You talk about family values
Well I'll tell you that's a joke
You talk about family values
While on some young boy's cock you choke
You make me sick with what you do
Lies and guilt and hate are what you spew
You do it over and over and over again
Take your god and shove it up your ass
Treating women like they're servants
Like they're baby factories
Treating gays like some sickness
You're so fucking diseased
You say I can't beat off or screw
Or else I'm going to hell
I'll beat off right in your fucking face
You think I fucking care
You make me sick with what you do
Lies and guilt and hate are what you spew
You do it over and over and over again
Take your god and shove it up your assWe stand against every lie they tell

Then you have to start with yourself
So if George Bush wants to end terrorism
He should go ahead and kill himself
I will not sign my blind faith away
To an unjust leader 
Corporate masters live in their lavish pool
Of extreme wealth and excess
Whoa whoa
The phrase world leaders
Does not describe the heads of state
Those few in power
Work only for the corporate sake
No action no interest no humanity at all
As the corporate towers rise up
They watch the people fall
A government untouchable by the people
Run by the corporations of the world
Enslaving mothers fathers sons and daughters
Profits put before people
Equal force equal reaction
Equal suppression equal rebellion
Will not sign my blind faith away
To an unjust leader 
Corporate masters live in their 'cess pools
Of extreme wealth and excess
Whoa whoa
The phrase world leaders
Does not describe the heads of state
Those few in power
Work only for the corporate sake
No action no interest no humanity at all
Corporate towers rise up
We've got to make a change
No religions sexual preference
And regardless of your race
We've got to make a change
No war corporate run
Governments no police state
We've got to make a change
For the good of the human race
We've got to make a change
For the good of the human

What I thought was the New Millennium is 1984
Mr Orwell from the grave adding fresh ink to the page
As the unpresident declares an endless war
Welcome to 1984
Feels like Nazi Germany and Hitler on TV
As the unpresident spews homophobic speech
Didn't the allies fight a war to end extremist fascist law

Democracy lays trampled on the floor
Man isn't freedom great

Everything that I see
There's no future for me
Everything that I read
There's no future for me for me for me

The future the future
The future the future belongs to meI heard a man on the radio saying We're facing an economic hell
It creates a vision in my head of ten thousand kids sent off to kill
There's always a voice says that You've got a choice
But a choice between shit is still shit
Resistance resistance I won't be used
By a fascist corporation a rightwing politician
I'm not a slave not a tool fuck you
Resistance resistance I won't be used
By a fascist corporation a rightwing politician
I'm not a slave not a tool fuck you
I've got an idea in my head and I know it's nothing new
But it seems to me a better plan than being used and being screwed
Think your safe to spread your hate from behind your iron gates
Your walls will never be strong enough to keep us down
Resistance resistance I won't be used
By a fascist corporation a rightwing politician
I'm not a slave not a tool fuck you
Resistance resistance I won't be used
By a fascist corporation a rightwing politician
I'm not a slave not a tool fuck you
Sometimes there is not a choice
Like when your backs against the wall
So it's better to make a move
Before they've set you up to fall
So you so you better organize
So you so you better open eyes
So you so you better sound out loud the call
Before you find your back is up against the wall
Their fuckin' wall yeah
Resistance resistance I won't be used
By a fascist corporation a rightwing politician
I'm not a slave not a tool fuck you
Resistance resistance I won't be used
By a fascist corporation a rightwing politician
I'm not a slave not a tool fuck you
Resistance resistanceThere is no ardor that you know
Where is the axiom that we're owed
And how do you fucking sleep
You haven't missed a wink
There is no allegiance where you go
Your surefire mandates are theoretical
'Cause you're anti anti antithetic to the cure
You're anti anti antithetic to the cure
So an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
This mortal solution are you sure
How do you fucking sleep
You haven't missed a wink
There is no honor where you are
Your surefire carte blanche is theoretical
'Cause you're anti anti antithetic to the cure
You're anti anti antithetic to the cure
Anti anti antithetic to the cure
Anti anti antithetic to the cureGo the constitution crumbles beneath the weight of fascists
No right to assemble no free speech for the masses
Seattle '99 at the mayors decree
AntiWTO statements are grounds for arresting
Our leaders decry Tianamen
And speak of freedom
As they unleash our cops on us
So what's the fuckin' difference
Behind locked doors in session
Corporate sponsored politicians
Structure policy to build more corporate strength
Fight strength with strength
At news conferences they claim we listen
While they lock out their own constituents
So we march on to raise our voice
Because we are left with no choice
In China Nike pays workers fifty cents a day
In the US lawmakers give China free trade
Human rights based sanctions just washed away
When our lawmakers are owned by multinationals money
Our leaders decry Tianamen
And speak of freedom
As they unleash our cops on us
So what's the fuckin' differenceWe've got just 30 seconds
to sing to you about
Nationalism facism
corporate greed hate
Nazis and the president
The downfall of the state
We've got just 30 seconds
to sing to you about
Sexism corporate whores
The Pope and rape
Christian fucks
right wing whores
The problems that we face
We've got to bring it to an endthe rich control the world's economic state creating poverty for their own sake poverty breeds crime that threatens you so you support the police in what ever they do you give up your rights don't you know the truth it makes no difference they don't protect you don't protect you don't protect you don't protect you don't protect you and that's the truth this police state only benefits the rich because the cops give them power to keep us all quiet with police disguised as the guardians of the masses we'll never suspect their role is to save the rich bastards you're all complacent you're totally fooled you bought the system's lies but they don't protect you don't protect you don't protect you don't protect you don't protect you you've been taught to eat the complacency brand fed to you by your rich slave masters hand you don't need to stand against this covert class war because you're brainwashed in the laws some old rich bastard's wrote and the police would kill you if they could that's their job no they don't protect you don't protect you don't protect you don't protect you don't protect youAll night out on the streets
I got the back of all my friends
We never want to go back home
Never want the night to end
Because we want to be free
We want to be free
We want to be free
We want to be free free free
We want to be free
We want to be free
We want to be free
We want to be free free free free
The schools that they send us to are prisons
The same can be said for their churches too
I don't want my mind or my arms tied in bondage
I don't want to be another cloned state toolI was in Chico California talking to a foreigner
When a fascist threatened me
He hoped to threaten to harass
'Cause although he could kick my ass he knew
He could never kill what I believe
The best of the best the best in the world the USA
Sinking no drowning in a sea of excess gluttony
As the rest of the world does struggle to keep up the pace
It seems America got it right by doing
The rest of the world doing wrong
Zero knowledge of understanding of US governmental actions
in the states of overseas Mystified history
Quotes spewed from corporate media waves
Turns the public into a herd of sheep
'Equal Rights' 'Justice' 'Democratic Role' 'Freedom' 'Equality'
All just a total fuck you
Empty words in the President slurs in every speech
While scheming behind closed doors with the CIA
To undermine democracy to undermine autonomy
To undermine the stability of any leftist populous regime
Making the President a terrorist making the USA a terrorist
US tax dollars fund terror terror terror terror
It seems America must have gotten it rightThe hearse marches into work in black and white uniform
Dressed for that funeral not a fly viewing his burial
Yeah see those reclaiming through revolving doors
They prey on corporate locals and remove their souls
Whoaoh you do what you're told
Whoaoh whoaoh you do what you're told do what you're told
In the tallest buildings on the block on one way streets the tickers tock
Another suit is lost one more head on the chopping block
Whoaoh you do what you're told
Whoaoh whoaoh you do what you're told do what you're told
Yeah
There must be more to this life We must be worth more than our work
Who you want your job will define another victim of a daily crime

BastardsA psychic said to me  
She said You know I gotta a very special feeling
That truth and freedom will break out today

Cause there's a message in the cards it reads
Today's the day to break the fuckin' mold
SMASH IT TO PIECES
while singing 12 1234
Paper to pen yeah smash it all to pieces
Become a vehicle that blossoms thruth and freedom
Every city every street every town
new pulse heartbeat
A vision came to me  
Not in a dream while sitting at the subway station
Waiting for the train to take me away

It might have been an angel or a ghost 
I don't know
But its message came through
shining crystal clear
SMASH IT TO PIECES
while singing 12 1234
There's not a name you can assign it
More than a movement
it's the fabric that makes up a human being
There's nothing stupid but love
caring peace instead of guns
So now we've got to
take to that message to the streets
Through our art through our hard work
get on your feetFirst they came for the Communists and I did not speak out
Then they came for the socialists and I did not speak out
Next they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out

In tickers and broadcasts through power lines
Freedom buried in sound bites buried in headlines
And we sing

No right to assemble  no free speech for the masses
Seattle '99 the mayors decree
AntiWTO statements are grounds for arresting

Our leaders decry Tianamen
And dare to speak of freedom
As they unleash our cops on us
So what's the fuckin' difference

Behind locked doors in session
World sponsored corporate politicians
Structure policy to build more coporate strength
Fight strength  with strength
At news conferences they claim we listen

So we march on to raise our voice
Because we are left with no choice
In China Nike pays workers fifty cents a day
In the US lawmakers give China free trade
Human rightsbased sanctions just washed away
When our lawmakers are owned by multinational's moneywant to tell you a little story 'bout a party that went all
right
but went all wrong i want to tell you a little story 'bout a
party in this song
it happened back in '93
in the pittsburgh punk rock scene an event that will go
down
in infamy it was all the master plan
of one legendary punk rock kid his name was spaz
SPAZ
an eviction notice sent to his house sparked off an idea
i should have one last party al my place
so off he set with his master plan the invitations in his hand
read
you're invited to my house destruction party
spaz's house destruction party
it was chaos with no end if you were crazy enough
to make the house destruction party then you know
you're lucky that you lived we played there st patrick's
day
with submachine and the bad genes in a basement full of
debris
from kicked in doors broken glass
kicked in walls the place was trashed the house was now
missing
its support beams the bathrooms had no toilets or sinks
left
in them there was nothing in the kitchen left to break aut
rotten spray painted on walls
drunk punks passed out in the halls and this was just the second
night
or a threeday long party the cops showed up
and all the kids went piling out the back i remember running
away
and hiding out in the lot behind the squirrel hill mellon bank
the cop said
i want to speak to someone who lives here
and this punk kid said she did he asked
is this the condition this house has always been in
she answered ah yeah it isIt's in the paper every day
I see it in the headlines and I feel so sick yeah
Another life leaves this world so full of hate
But short
Short on compassion
Short on humanity
Asking myself in vain shaken by the shock
do we even have a chance
I don't wanna die

I don't wanna kill

We are all human
It's time to prove it
This is a plea for peace 
To the oppressors of the world and to
To the leaders of nations corporate profit takers
to the everday citizen
Greed envy fear hate the competition has to stop
When you see someone down now's the time to pick them up
Set our differences aside and never look back no
I don't wanna die

I don't wanna kill

We are all human
It's time to prove it
Isn't everybody tired of the fighting 
Isn't everybody tired of the killing 
Isn't everybody tired of the dying 
Isn't everybody tired of the hatred 
Violence fighting killingdying aaaaaah

And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow
I still have a dream
we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children
black men and white men
Jews and Gentiles Protestants and Catholics will be able to join
hands and sing
Free at last free at last
Thank God Almighty we are free at last
I don't wanna die

I don't wanna kill

We are all human
It's time to prove it
We are all human
It's time to prove it
We are all humanA N A R C H Y

Instead he stands outside the halls and pan handles for beer
Then sneaks into the hall to deface the bathroom mirror

His name is Captain Anarchy but only in his mind
A N A R C H Y
So punk that he's a poser and he'll be one till he dies
You never saw an anarchist with such perfect hair

In reality it was paid for by his mommy and his dad

Submitted by Melwhy don't you come over here and see what you have created it'll make 
you laugh so hard you'll cry and lookin' into the black you made me so 
far past sick lookin' into your eyes i wish you'd die no more dead 
well i've seen the crosses burnt and holy and the people they all come 
down they're screaming hey man it's a fix and i looked into the 
cause in which you were striving towards and i thought thought of the 
wasted wasted youth no more dead he's lying all alone his life 
is stolen yes it's gone into the black of night can't you see it was no 
fault of his own trapped into a ghetto bred into a slum killing his 
own instead of rich white men and he's never gonna escape from it now 
because it's over and he's dead the end
Submitted by MelIt's gonna take some action and some reaction from
From me and you
'Cause you gotta stand up and you gotta make demands to
Obtain the truth
Time after time there are so many secret
Decisions made
Where we have no choice and no representation
And have to say
It's in front of your face it's in front of your eyes
But you must open your eyes if you're to see the truth
It's in front of your face
But you must open your eyes if you're to see the truth
It's in front of your face
But you must open your eyes if you're to see the truth
It's in front of your face
But you must open your eyes if you're to see the truth
They try to tell us it's a free democracy which
Runs this country
But nobody wants to talk about the CIA files
Files we can't see
National Security concerns a whole country but
We have no say
Our security blamed for our restricted freedom a game
The government plays
It's in front of your face it's in front of your eyes
But you must open your eyes if you're to see the truth
It's in front of your face
But you must open your eyes if you're to see the truth
It's in front of your face
But you must open your eyes if you're to see the truth
It's in front of your face
But you must open your eyes if you're to see the truth
When there are secrets that we don't know
Then the ideal they pass as freedom in this country is a fake
But we are left with no right or no voice to choose
Then we're not living in a free and democratic state
It's in front of your face it's in front of your eyes
But you must open your eyes if you're to see the truth
It's in front of your face
But you must open your eyes if you're to see the truth
It's in front of your face
But you must open your eyes if you're to see the truth
It's in front of your face
But you must open your eyes if you're to see the truth
It's what you don't know no no no no
It's what you don't know no no no no
It's what you don't know no no no no
It's what you don't know
Lost on the street because you don't know what to do
There's something in your heart that's coming over you
SOMETHING IN YOU
SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART
It takes you back to a better time and place
The leaders of this world have shortchanged the human race

Don't you know it starts with you and that it starts with me
This is the new fucking millennium 
We're going to turn the world UPSIDE DOWN 
It's time to show some true humanity
And time to show we truly care
For the world
For each other
For those we've known
Through all our years

We've spent our lives living in their past
Now we're building building a new future
We've spent our lives living in their past
Now we're building building a new future
We've spent our lives living in their past
One look at the world and it promts these words
WE DON'T NEED ITWatching TV talk shows is a lot of fun
people who are shooting guns
I like it when they always have on
Inbred couples from West Virginia
inbred people who want to kill you
I saw a story about a man
and his wife was fucking her mother
who was fucking his daughter
it was the kind of thing
that'd make you want to shoot up
Tonight's gonna be a really good time
and get really fucking high
I'll shoot some guns
I'm gonna go out
you know I'll probably end up
I'll drive around in my car
at the fucking bar
get real high
And while I'm there I'm gonna
I'm gonna kick some ass
I'm gonna fuck shit up
I'll kick you in your fucking teeth
if you get in my way because
I'M HAVING A GOOD DAY
and I don't want you there
You've got your hand holding
No you'll
Be at home watching your TV set
your fucking dick
and you're cumming
in your fucking mouth OKArm in Arm  Fists held high
set them free  our battle cry
Take back the streets
And our right to free speech
Locked up and put away
For fear of what they'll say
CHORUS
Crooked cops plus crooked judges don't equal justice
Free all political prisoners
Racist cops plus racist judges don't equal justice
Free all political prisoners
Brick by brick  wall by wall
Wont sit back  let our brothers and sisiters fall
The unjust justice system
Our voice will overthrow

There are options to choose I call it social progress
Progress to not be abused
They were arrested for their views
It was the protesters they screwed
And stil had the nerve to ask
Who I was voting for
'Cause when you silence our youth
Then you silence the truth
Our right not to remain yeah
Start funding lives that move for changes
Not funding leaders that oppress and use
When politicians become nothing but major corporations
Posing as humans real humans lose
They were arrested for their views
It was the protesters they screwed
And stil had the nerve to ask
Who I was voting for
'Cause when you silence our youth
Then you silence the truth
Our right not to remain
Silent

Suppression10 easy steps to create an enemy and start a war
Listen closely because we will all see this weapon used in our lives
It can be used on a society of the most ignorant to the most highly educated
We need to see their tactics as a weapon against humanity and not as truth
First step create the enemy Sometimes this will be done for you
Second step be sure the enemy you have chosen is nothing like you
Find obvious differences like race language religion dietary habits
fashion Emphasize that their soldiers are not doing a job
they are heartless murderers who enjoy killing
Third step Once these differences are established continue to reinforce them
with all disseminated information
Fourth step Have the media broadcast only the ruling party's information
this can be done through state run media
Remember in times of conflict all forprofit media repeats the ruling party's information
Therefore all forprofit media becomes staterun
Fifth step show this enemy in actions that seem strange militant or different
Always portray the enemy as nonhuman evil a killing machine

THIS IS HOW TO CREATE AN ENEMY THIS IS HOW TO START A WAR
THIS IS HOW TO CREATE AN ENEMY
Sixth step Eliminate opposition to the ruling party
Create an Us versus Them mentality Leave no room for opinions in between
One that does not support all actions of the ruling party should be considered a traitor
Seventh step Use nationalistic andor religious symbols and rhetoric to define all actions
This can be achieved by slogans such as freedom loving people versus those who hate freedom
This can also be achieved by the use of flags
Eighth step Align all actions with the dominant deity
It is very effective to use terms like It is god's will or god bless our nation
Ninth step Design propaganda to show that your soldiers
have feelings hopes families and loved ones
Make it clear that your soldiers are doing a duty they do not want or like to kill
Tenth step Create and atmosphere of fear and instability
and then offer the ruling party as the only solutions to comfort the public's fears
Remembering the fear of the unknown is always the strongest fear

We are not countries We are not nations We are not religions
We are not gods We are not weapons We are not ammunition We are not killers
We will NOT be tools
Mother fuckers
I will not die
I will not kill
I will not be your slave
I will not fight your battle
I will not die on your battlefield
I will not fight for your wealth
I am not a fighter
I am a human beingBreakout
So we breakout

And a postwar breakdown

And a postwar hero

I've got an id I've got an ego 
I've got pocketbook no dough 
Just a postwar shock job
I'm an evilminded breakdown
I'm a vulgar thinking crackdown
I'm a noncommie drifter
I'm an exgi for sure oh sure
Just a postwar nerve case in a prowar age
And a postwar history face let's face our history now
I've got a medal I'm a hero 
I've got an id I've got an ego

Pulled over by racist boys in blue in Brentwood P A
There's no real reason they don't have any right
It's just that in their eyes he's not the correct shade of white
Driving in a neighborhood that's reigned by whites
Ain't healthy for a black man trying to live a lengthy life
All those cops they walked off free but him he's in a grave
His name is Johnny Gammage one of thousands they have slain
We've got no rights
When cops can kill
It's not right
We live in fear
We've got no rights

Patrol man cruising in his car at night
Just looking for some homeys he can rough up in a fight
Pulled over 3 kids in a total rage
Next thing you know there's bodies all over the place
His back up came and they're all acting tough
3 kids vs 6 or 7 cops all armed with billy clubs
The cops they did it just 'cause those kids color and their age
They say That's not the truth but this happens every fucking day
We've got no right

There was no choice given to make

I don't believe

I don't believe in America
Or the American dream
I don't believe in nationalism

Until the rich old men who control the world
Find something they can't have
And they send us out there to kill each other
Let the rich fight their wars themselves

One day while standing in my room
You came in preaching your words predicting doom
You've never once been happy with me
Because I'm not what you want me to be no
Tried to teach me to pray and go to school
Tried to teach me to be the tool
Yeah ya missed that I was smart enough to see
That their system doesn't work for you or me
Oh don't believe what they say is true
Oh their system doesn't work for you
Oh you can be what you want to be
Oh don't have to choose to join the corporate army
For God give up your life
Try to figure out what's wrong or right
Never tried to stop look to see
You're exactly what you're told to be
You did everything fucking right
Followed the system's guiding light
And now you fucking bitch to me to get a job
You don't like the life you've got
You fucking corporate whore
Oh don't believe what they say is true
Oh their system does not work for you
Oh you can be what you want to be
Oh don't have to join the fucking army
Don't have to join their corporate army
Don't have to don't have to noAll united all as one
Let's make a stand
We've got a privilege in the power
That we command
So let's not drown in ignorance
And let our strength waste away
As the richest nation in the world
We've got a responsibility
Vieques Puerto Rico
A protectorate of the USA
Part a home to native families
The rest a navy bombing range
Shells misfired kill civilians there
And napalm hangs in the island air
But the government beats down
Protests against this misuse
So stand up fight back resist refuse
'Cause if we don't do it no one's going to
So stand up fight back resist refuse
'Cause if we don't do it no one's going to
I look into the eyes
Of a dead island boy's face
His eyes remind me of another's
From different time and place
Where Abombs baked the ground
On bikini's tropical lands
Where a culture was erased
Families misplaced by a Naziesque like plan
All done in your name by uncle Sam
So if we don't fight it then we're guilty too
So stand up fight back resist refuse
'Cause if we don't do it no one's going to

Start
Pledge allegiance to a flag
Of which you're taught no history
Not Mexico Granada
Panama or Middle East
But they're just a mere fraction
Of this country's shady past
Skeletons locked in the closet
And I doubt they'll be the last
National interest defined for you
But who's it really serve Who's getting screwed
Reciting back their facts and numbers
That don't make you smart
There's much more to intelligence
And thinking for yourself it would be a start

Yeah it would be a start

Some fucking rich kid crying cause her her boy friend left her cold
To make us feel sorry for some fucking millionaire

Well I said Fuck this propaganda fuck the news it just
You'll scream tonight so throw it away
You'll scream tonight so stay away stay away
It's a commercial about some Barbie type clone blond
She's six foot four and only weighs one hundred pounds
They sell her body and her self esteem out loud
she looks so natural like a fucking starving child
Some old man sits there drooling at this fucking smut
If she'd take off her shirt well now that would be good luckYou can spoon my eyes out
But I can still see through you
Slice my ears from my head

You can murder the rebel

You can't murder the rebellion
Sawed my feet at the ankles
But I wasn't going to run

So he grabbed my face
And sliced off my tongue
Lock off each hand at the wrist
So I can't raise my fist
You can kill the protester

I did my best to make it in the world
I plowed by sweat in tears into the fertile
Generation generation generated what was needed
for supply to meet demand
The sun shone bright on the ancient range
Then the promise of the future turned the NeoLiberal Plain
The people's voice shut up shut down abstain
Is it gonna take a martyr to end the charade
They tell you that you're out of luck
While people fall they watch their profits rocket up
SOS this is a global call
You better make a stand
You better make it now
Take back your rights from the IMF World Bank and Monsanto
SOS this is a global call
You better make a stand
You better make it now
Corporatocracy leads to profits for killers
profits for killers no
Geneva to Washington Cancun to Seoul
The Corporate Welfare State running out of control
The Corprocrats have got the guns but their numbers are few
They can kill democracy but they cannot kill the truth
 Step out on the matrix of the corporate slave
 Step into the world of the living wage
Not for one not for two not for three or four
But for every single citizen around the fucking world
The people in the fight of our lives
The spark of revolution in a farmers' suicide
SOS this is a global call
You better make a stand
You better make it now
Take back your rights from the IMF World Bank and Monsanto
SOS this is a global call
You better make a stand
You better make it now
Corporatocracy leads to profits for killers
Just a bunch of killers
profits for killers
When they wage war on you you lay asleep
When they poison your food you choose to drink
There's poison in the well
Yeah

Monsanto are killers kkkkkillers

Syngenta are killers kkkkkillers

The World Bank are killers kkkkkillers 

The WTO are killers kkkkkillers 
Oh noPoliticians talk of freedom they talk in this country that we live in
They talk free to be harassed and be beaten by the pigs
Your rights no rights till you're fucking broken crippled
Or until you're fucking dead
They pass laws unfair to gays
Their work and separatist laws to keep the nonwhites in their place
Their work family values as a smoke screen blowing in your face
Their truth no truth family values isn't something
That shouldn't be based on hate
Justice presides over them late into the night
A blindfold covering their eyes but something isn't right
Under their arms there are shackles on her legs
And the hands that once held up her scales
Are bound are bound in chains
And behind their closed doors they conspire through the night
More work sick work and they won't stop
Until this nation is all straight and all white
They call it a free nation but all it is is a Nazi nationThe summer sun sunsets the cityscape rise up
All the kids in the hall come together put your fists up
Il bring the mic if you bring the sound system
Wee got all night to get lost in the rhythm
The stage is set the dives a wreck
5 dollars at the door and it feels so perfect
Said all I know is that I don know nothing
Wee got all night so there aint no sense in rushing

It time our time 
Our voice our stage our vision our community
Alright tonight 
The youth are waging war
Don you know wee gonna win this fight
It time our time 
Our voice our stage our vision our community
Alright tonight 
Turn it up turn it out lets go
This conscious flame burns so bright in our vision in our sight
It illuminates it radiates to rage against this dying light
It in our veins pumping passion deep into our soul
The missing link that finally made this puzzle whole
Oh now I know our visions clear
We are the voice of revolution infecting all who hear
See all we wanted was a place to call our own
And a chance to speak our minds so we don have to feel alone

Youe gotta stay alert
gotta stay aware
gotta stay involved
Alert Aware Involved What's left now that we crawl over every stretch of earth we want
millennia of wars with things that didn't know that they were at war with us
We fought people too but always them and now what's left is we
We  the conquerors the kings  the ones that'll learn to fall the hardest
We've come so far and only just begun
The damage wrought runs deep
Please save the humans
Sick feelings as we turn on our neighbors covetously
opaque seeds of culture warring against us laying siege internally
But that's the way it's done so this is how we die
yet we balk and choke at the idea that things could be otherwise
This house of cards so big now stands alone
With it will fall all stability and hope
Diversity slows progress so it's clear what we must do
destroy anything not interchangeable with our pursuits
But not all of our ends weigh equal not all of our ends are shared
Not all of us have destroyed but we can all die in the end
All humans united in a uniquely human destiny
Created by us for us Hooray for todayHe knew he was gonna get it bad
As his dad bailed him out of jail
Leading him from the station
By a handful of his hair he said
I just don't know what to do with you boy
I just don't understand
What the hell makes you act like this
And looking back this lost punk said
I found the meaning of life
I found it dad
You're only born so you can die
So you can die so you can die so you can die
But her dad beat her every day and night
She was showered in money
She cut her wrists at seventeen
She was showered with jewels
And there was nothing she could do
Everyone wondered why
She had it all
She was rich and pretty
But alone each night she'd cry
She found it now
She found the meaning of life
You're only born so you can die
So you can die so you can die yeah
They found it now

If every page was torn from the magazine
Would gas still drive the media machine
The products they mean us to pursue are endless
Identity can leave you selfless

On and on we sing out songs and
On and on the wars wage on and

I hope you choke on every pill

We were just killing time looking for something new
Then someone came 'long with a guitar
And we just started to play and we sang Clash songs
And the songs of our lives until late into the night
That's youth that's all that's all that's all that's all
That's youth that's all that's all that's all that's all
We'd only been friends for a short time but in just an hour or two it was like
We'd been friends our entire lives though
And I was so in love with you but not sure if I should say it
But then I thought yeah I'm scared and I don't know if I should
But I'll do it anyway

And you're so sick of all the in crowd trying to be cool
And still you don't still you don't know what to do
But in the end you do your own thing
And you tell 'em to get screwed

Submitted by MelPoison free now living life so pure
Tell me have all your addictions been cured
When you mark your fist what's going through your mind
Is this your new fix
Ensnared again confined
Transference of one addiction to another you haven't solved a thing
All you've done is change the game you've been playing
Different equipment the rules are the same  the goal remains unscathed
Just looking for acceptance and the power that it brings
Push your self to higher heights  rise above the herd
Straightedge isn't the answer if the decision isn't yours
Push your self higher
Think about the life you live
Have your standards been met
Or have you rooted yourself  cemented in and set
Projection of your addiction to another the mind is a powerful tool
Consume a symbol you've now become addicted to
Just one of the pack with a pat on the back marked fist finger in the air
Tell me would you tell me could you if your friends were not thereThe President got caught getting head
So soon some people will be dead
Iraqi bodies scattered around
By the cluster bombs that land in their barracks and their homes
They get on TV and openly state
That Saddam Hussein should be removed from his place
If anybody said that about the US President
The US military would rip them a new ass
So where is the real terrorist
In the Middle East or in the US
So who is the real terrorist
Is it Saddam Hussein or your own Presidentthey use the flag to control us brainwash us to be their patriotic 
slaves program our minds by controlling what we learn the only 
difference from the nazis is that someone tried to stop them red white 
and brainwashed the government says they're working for us just as long 
as we increase their pay but the minute they get into office we're a 
hasbeen a yesterday red white and brainwashed the red stands for the 
blood of all the people we've slain the white for this racist bigoted 
foundation the blue for your aryan eyes  all empty empty because 
you're taught to bow down to the man fly that flag that flag of 
freedom do what you can for your country go and fight their wars 
for them they're not following in our footsteps kill them red white 
and brainwashed they call that being a patriot i just call it ignorant 
if you don't fight to make thing better then you're the one betraying 
this country red white and brainwashed

this country named america is built on graves
of the natives who lived here before genocide took place
the word america means freedom  as in free to kill the free
chorus
don't fly those stripes those starsandstripes for me
it's the same today as then as US dollars are spent
to rid the native insurgence in Mexico and any other US interests
the 3rd world is a modern day playground for multinational companies
and the tax dollars we're forced to pay fund these heartless US policies
their explanation it's national interest national security
at little big horn national cemetery there's a monument that reads
to the soldiers killed in montana while clearing hostile indians away'
and there's a flag there flying high over the fallen killers' graves
when they call on me to die for them i'll say not meIt's gonna take some action and some reaction from
 from me and you
 obtain the truth
Time after time there are so many secret
'Cause you gotta stand up and you gott make demands to
 decisions made
Where we have no choice and no representation
 and have no say
It's in front of your face 
But you must open your eyes if you're to see the truth
They try to tell us as a free democracy we
 file we can't see
NATIONAL SECURITY concerns a whole country but
 run this country
 the government plays
But nobody wants to talk about the CIA files
Our security blamed for our restricted freedom a game
 we have no say
It's in front of your face
if youre to see the truth

But you must open your eyes
Then the ideal they pass as freedom in this country is a fake
When there are secrets that we don't know
When we are left with no right or no voice to choose
Then we're not living in a free  democratic state

But you must open your eyes
It's in front of your face
if youre to see the truthIf I had a lighter in hands
With some oily rags
Is that what it'd take
To wake you from your sleep
Woke up from your american dreams
To be surrounded
Surrounded in flames
You got to scream
To make your voice heard
And I won't stop screaming
Until mine is heard
Wake up
Wake up
To the world around you
Wake up
Wake up
To the world around you
Wake up
Wake up
To the world around you
Wake up
Wake up
Yeah
And if we blocked the streets
Everyday
Face down on the pavement
As we lay
You're angered
'cause you're five minutes late
What happens next time
When we will stop you all day
Yeah next time
When we will stop you all day
You got to scream
To make your voice heard
And I won't stop screaming
Until mine is heard
Wake up
Wake up

FreedomSlaughtered by the hands of a butcher
The hands of the butcher were the hands of a Doctor and
And these are the golden days that you want to bring back
Making it illegal won't make it go away
The rich will fly to far off lands the poor will stay and pray
That their back alley abortion is clean and safe
You can't make it go away so why endanger women's lives
Because the issue here for you isn't life
It's control control of what we do and say
But you'll never gain control control control
Is to value life to move a factory to
The place that you can most easily fuck those laboring for you
That isn't what I call a high value on life
Yet that is the policy of those on the right
Who back the brainwashed Jesus jumpers with the cash flow for the fight
But we won't let you control our lives
We're not gonna be herded like your flock of sheep
I value life more than anything
And your false morals can't do a thing to brainwash me
I'll never be yours yours yours
And there's no justice in a system
That's run by greedy old men who want to control our lives
There's no justice in a system
That's run by greedy old men who want to control on our lives

You're not gonna controlA brand new history
Slyly and quickly
Sparkles in your eyes
Hope your not missing
The flash points sign posts
Etching the future from here
Ancient ancestors transmitting
Via pool formed from rainfall
Where my reflection
Stares back at me and says
As the sun sets bright over ancient earth
And disappears from view
The spirit of the world
Will rise up from the dis again
Our voices sing in union
Lifeless soulless secret abyss
Plotting the worlds doom
Production and consumption
Wakes the sleeping world to sing again
Our voices sing in union
From African Coasts
To Australian Mainland
Watch your brothers back
Watch your sisters back
From the American Plains
To the Sea of Japan
Watch your brothers back
Watch your sisters back
In your own backyard
Or far off foreign lands
We find our adversaries
Woven of the same thread
As evil hacks and rips
At every corner of the world
The peoples voice will sing as one voice
Our voices sing in union
To implement a Paul Hawken Esque
Model for the world
The people voice will sing as one voice
Our voices sing in union
The Arabian Sea
To the Coast of Chile
Watch your brothers back
Watch your sisters back

To the Bay of Biscay
Watch your brothers back

the older i become i dont care if im occasionally bored
i used to think that some how i was missing out
if i wasnt where all the fun was
usually it was a whole lot of nothing
most the people were pretty lame
yet i would go along and luagh
when all the punch lines were all the same
there used to be a time when i couldnt sit without the tv on
kept trying to run away from something going wrong
kept my mind busy and ran myself into the ground
there were plenty things i was avoiding
usually it was a whole lot of nothing
yet it consumed my mind
wouldnt stop to catch my breath
i was to affraid of what i'd find
now i am for peace of mind so i left these empty things behind
because what i had was a whole lot of nothing
i believe we rip what we sow and the truth i got to know
was the sum of a whole lot of nothing
 s U s P i R o We came a long way
From the first day
We set foot
Underground  indoors
In the damp  in the cold
To find our new home
So I finally found myself
Finally found a place to call home
Underground  indoors
Very damp  very cold
Warm in heart
 we find a way to break these chains
Find a way to erase the day
Find some way
Fill our voidyou've gotta die gotta die gotta die for your government die for your 
country that's shit there's a gulf war vet dying a slow cold death 
and the government says we don't know the source of his sickness but

Voices say rip your heart
They're on their way
Now boy I'm watching me
Boy what are the odds
They're saying Murder me

They're drunk

Ahhh
God DammitI'm gonna hang out with myself
I won't be in debt to anybody
Or have to worry about pushing anyone
'Cause I don't want them around
And everybody around me has told me things that I don't believe
Seems like everyone around is pleased when I'm not happy
I'm all alone again
And I'm perfectly content for now
As I dream of somewhere else
I won't have to answer to anybody
Or have to listen to the moronic views that I hear everywhere
As I wonder I start to doubt that anyone would have relief
To a lie he's gonna say before I walk away

summer's night
I said Goodbye to you on a
with you but oh it's too late
Now I wish that I had stayed
next thing I knew was that
you'd been in an attack
and you were laying in a cold
morgue stuffed into a body bag
I saw you last night you said I
And where'd I get the idea you
were gone
was wrong
I woke up to sounds of my own
I woke up in a sweat it was just
screams
and on
a dream
and that dream goes on and on
with it ever end Well I don't I

davey destroyed the punk scene
it's already destroyedYou push and push a people what are they to do
Soon this corporate run government will be through
See it doesn't represent the people anymore
Big business are pimps the governments' are whores
We don't need more time to talk over a solution
We know what we need we need a fucking revolution
We don't need your war machine or your filthy blood stained dollars
We've got one thing you don't have we've got we've got we've
Got the numbers got the numbers got the numbers
Got the numbers got the numbers
To you the masses are not even human beings
We're dogs that will be grateful for any scraps you leave
But even dogs will only put up with so much abuse
Keep stealing like us so we're gonna let loose
We don't need more time to talk over a solution
We know what we need we need a fucking revolution
We don't need your war machine or your filthy blood stained dollars

As you can throw 'em
Because as strong as you may be
You won't be able to move 'em an inch
But you don't have to believe me
Go ahead and be the corporate stooge
That they trained you to be
And then you'll see what you get for your loyalty
They call it 'Down sizing'
But that's just a backhanded saying
For the phrase 'We're gonna screw you
Until you're down on your knees'
And you better not try to complain
Because there's another hundred stiffs like you
All who'd plead I'd kiss your ass just for a chance
To be a whore to your company
You see it every day everywhere
On the TV screen
Each time a different face or family
But it's always the same
We worked here all our lives
Gave them everything we had
And now they say they're gonna move the factory
To a Third World country where the labor is cheap
But the fact my friend that you don't see
Is the money you spend on the goods they make
Supports their methods of abuse on the Third World scene
And in your very own backyard yes your country
So I won't be the consumer that they want me to be
Because the goods I own aren't going to set me free
So I won't buy that crap they want to sell me
Because the goods I own won't set anyone free100 kids just having fun until you come your steroid arms and skinny head you cut your wrists slash your face call it performance art trying to be cool you're ignorant antiviolent antiviolent antiviolent anti anti you start a fight drink beer all night and molest little girls tell everyone there that you're psycho psy so psy psycho well i don't think you're psycho you're just another show off go and shoot up one one last time antiviolent antiviolent antiviolent anti anti we don't need your war we don't need your war we don't need your war antiviolent antiviolent antiviolent anti anti antiviolent antiviolent antiviolent anti antiEverything that you did Everything that you said You may as well be down at the mall cause that's no different than being at the bar I saw that look in your eyes It made me realize that you changed changed from what you were and now you're no better than a pop culture whore I can't stand being with you I can't stand the bar scene you're in too Can't you see what you've become It's every f**king thing that you swore you'd always snub I can't stand being with being with Sit there like all the old fools perched up high on your bar stool One day you told me I'll never be like them but I don't see a difference from the outside looking in All the punks at the bar like they could start up a war Revolution plotted in a bottle the thought makes the laugh and 1 turn on some Nirvana I can't stand being with you And I can't stand the drugs scene you're in too Can't you see that what you've become It's every f**king thing that you swore you'd always snub I can't stand being being with youthe berlin wall falls in the east the west claims triumph we've really

but I don't see a difference from the outside looking in

About face snap to attention
Form your own conclusions to the things you see
About face sometimes the explanations
Don't add up to the facts
Time and again they manufacture a cause
And rally the public around it check out the movie Wag The Dog
Killing to further the interest of private corporations
Killing to control global economic situations
Killing for personal gain ie Bush in Panama
Learn the fuckin' truth you won't be so quick to sign on
About face snap to attention
Form your own conclusions to the things you see
About face sometimes the explanations
Don't add up to the facts
Our lives reflect TV sitcoms and tragedies
Like a bad joke I ask How many of you don't see and just how many
How many of you swallow the lies
How many of you do not realize
Gung ho and true to the Stars and Stripes
They fuckin' brainwashed you to do their bidding
And like a flock of sheep with wool over your eyes
You never stop to question you just fall into line
The media's a business that provides entertainment
Their bottom line money and stories that will make it
So they run with stories that promotes the lies
To keep the ratings coming wealth from promoting world strife
Life must be so easy when you don't have to think
Black and whit like printing from the newspaper's ink
I wish I had the chance to reveal all the lies
But you're so fucking brainwashed would it even help to try
To get through to you
To get through through through through through through
To get through to youAll right
I'm feeling slightly violent
I'm feeling slightly pissed
All my dreams in ruins
All my trusts were crushed
You don't even fucking know
What the hell is going on
Now they're gonna take it tear it up
Ask if there was something wrong
It didn't have to be like this
When I think about what we had
And what you threw away
It hurts me sad and slowly
If anything you're gonna pay
I don't want to hurt you
I just want you to see
Oh the fucking agony
We all have a voice
But I guess they're hard to hear
Don't know what to do
Never
Now I feel so alone
I just don't know what to do
Well now it's time to go
In the end all is lost
A little bit left behind
I never wanted to fall apart like that
I never wanted to lose your loveYou walk past an activist who is talking on the street
About political prisoners locked up in your own home state
And you think for just a minute you think for just a second
Then you say That can't be true
'Cause I live in the land of freedom where no one gets a screw
You turn your face you turn your back
You say That can't be true
You stay safe lost in your prefab world
'Cause you're sure it won't happen to you
You're sure it won't happen to you
Just wait till it happens to you
You heard it everyday since the first day of your life
But you never stopped to think what you heard was full of lies
You can't question for a minute can't question for a second
'Cause you're nothing but a tool
Who's blueprints are tailored and fashioned
Each night by the evening news
You turn your face you turn your back
You say That can't be true
You stay safe lost in your prefab world
'Cause you're sure it won't happen to you
You're sure it won't happen to you
Just wait till it happens to you
You could stand on the street talk 'til you're blue in the face
And they would not make you stop 'cause you have no power base
But if Dan Rather got on the Evening News
And said Its time for revolution
The FBI would fuck him up so bad
Hed wish he wasn't living
They call it America 'Land of the free home of the brave'
And they call it America 'Land of the free home of the brave'
Yeah they call it America 'Land of the free home of the brave'
More to the truth it's a murderer it's the land of the enslaved
Enslaved enslaved enslaved enslaved enslaved
You turn your face you turn your back
You say That can't be true
You stay safe lost in your prefab world
'Cause you're sure it won't happen to you
You're sure it won't happen to you
Youre sure it wont happen to

We gotta work to make the facts fit the false charges
Pull the wool over the eyes of the filthy masses
Stab the people in the back for the corporate choice
Roll the propaganda out using the people's voice
We don't want to talk about it
The press scribble scribble every halftruth spoke
Then shoot it round the country like an April fools joke
Hype the nation for a Desert Storm love affair
Wave the stars and stripes like you just don't care
They talk it up all day they talk it up all night
They talk until their face turns blue

But when the truth escapes the night and crawls into the day
We find the picture still askew
They don't want to talk talk talk talk talk about it

The same can be said for their churches too
I don't want my mind or my arms tied in bondage

When I'm with my friends when I'm at a show
Thats when everything is OK
Thats why I follow my heart every single day
Single day EVERY SINGLE DAYAs I look from this stage
At the hundreds of kids in this room with me
The truth is so plain and so obvious
I just can't help to see
That all of us we are one and the same
Only different in our ages and our names
How many times have you heard
That you're a bore or you're no good
I know that all of us have been there
That's why we're all here joined as one
We don't need that shit
This ain't no punk rock clique
We're as one at the show
And one after the show
We don't need that shit
This ain't no punk rock clique
Acceptance at the show
And then after the show
Society says that we're crazy
With Utopian unreal goals
But we're fighting for something we truly believe
And all I can say is I'm glad we do we do
And they can say what they want
Because our hearts are true true
True true true true true true
What we've had through these years
Has been so unforgettable
And what we've had through these years
Has been so unbelievable
What we've had through these years
Has been so unforgettable
And what we've had through these years
Has been so unbelievable
We don't need that shit
This ain't no punk rock clique

And one after the show
We don't need that shit
This ain't no punk rock clique

against a world that has forgotten them
and the media ask 'why are the kids so angry'
Afterwards they'll go back home
to their uncaring fathers and misunderstanding mothers
and they'll dream of a time when they're back again
with all their friends
at another show
where they will sing
'these are the days
these are the days we will never forget'
Sixteen and all alone
searching for a place to call her home
thinking about a bottle or maybe even worse
but she passed on selfdestruction when she found a better place
at the show with the kids the excitement of change
and singing along with every kid in the crowd
she breathed in deep
and she sang out loud
'these are the days
these are the days
these are the days we will never forget'
He was never called cool
no he never fit in
because he thought for himself
and he went against the trends
but the abuse at school was finally setting in yeah
till the day he found a place to go
with the other punk rockers
at the punk rock show
shoulder to shoulder with his new allies
he forget about school as tears came to his eyes
and he sang
'these are the days
these are the days
these are the days we will never forget no'
Sitting under the corner light
my six string in my hand
playing my songs all by myself
thinking no one out there could understand
but it wasn't too long before
i realized i was wrong
and i found myself singing from a stage
a chorus of voices singing along
and we sing
'these are the days
these are the days
these are the days we will never forget'
Yeah we sing
'these are the days
these are the days
these are the days we will never forget

Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life
So now you're livin'
So now you're livin'
Broken bones and broken glass 
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life
Close my eyes try to make it last
Outrun the wretched memories of my pastI lost my baby to a foreign war
She was cut down in the gunfire of the western world
She was livin' in sin I was livin' in a lie
She was caught up in the glimmer of a rich mans eye
I couldn't see her from the other side
They said son there is no glory in your pride
I will wait at the Brandenburg Gate
At the Brandenburg Gate I'll wait
I will wait at the Brandenburg Gate
At the Brandenburg Gate I'll wait I'll wait
Well I lost my baby to a foreign war
She was cut down in the gunfire of the western world
She was searching for salvation in the things you buy
I was finding all the reason to give up on life
If you love something and give it away
It can't come back unless you're free
I will wait at the Brandenburg Gate
At the Brandenburg Gate I'll wait
I will wait at the Brandenburg Gate
At the Brandenburg Gate I'll wait
I'll wait I'll wait I'll wait
Somewhere in the in between
Where the east and the west meet
In the 30 year war where I came clean
That's where you will find me
So I'll wait I'll wait
I will wait at the Brandenburg Gate
At the Brandenburg Gate I'll wait
I will wait at the Brandenburg Gate
At the Brandenburg Gate I'll wait

I will wait at the Brandenburg Gate
At the Brandenburg Gate I'll wait

I will wait at the Brandenburg Gate
At the Brandenburg Gate I'll wait
So I'll wait I'll wait I'll wait
I lost my baby to a foreign war
If you utter a sound
Don't make a move
We'll kill you
Then they gathered around me
One man took my right arm
And another man took my left
When the third man grabbed the front of my coat
Then thrown in to an automobile we go
Oh I wish
I could describe
The terror in that 20 mile ride
Oh I wish
I could describe
The terror in the beautiful California moonlight
In an auto with six man and chauffeur
Yeah these Christian patriots
They put fingers in my eyes and nose
As they subjected me to torture
Yeah the torture that a good fearing man
Is capable of conceiving
Oh I wish
I could describe
The terror in that 20 mile ride
Oh I wish
I could describe
The terror in the beautiful California moonlight
You won't kiss the American flag
Well by god we'll make you
We'll ram it down your throat
Sing the Star Spangled Banner with feeling
They put their autos together
So the lamp set a sickly stage light
Fourteen defenders of this country
All commanding me to undress
They poured tar over my body and hair
In the absence of feathers they rubbed sagebrush instead
Oh I wish
I could describe
The terror in that 20 mile ride
Oh I wish
I could describe
The terror in the beautiful California moonlight
My suffering was terrible
But my greatest pain was over youHow did we get into this mess
The question is a hypothetical
The answers are
Written on the face of the oppressed
Sent to death at just 19
Forevermore to be unseen
His mother with tears in her eyes
Crying to God she calls out Why
She'll find her answers
On the face of the oppressed
I bow my head in respect
Of the dead
Because we're all bogged down
And there ain't no fucking SOS
That's going to save our sinking ship
Because we're all bogged down
No there ain't no fucking SOS
That's gonna save our sinking ship

How did we get into this mess
The question is a bona fide literal
The answers are
Written on the face of the oppressed
We all know the answers why
They sold a lie to build Versailles
You can roll over and die
Or you can rain down hell tonight
You'll find your answer
On the face of the oppressed
I bow my head in respect
Of the dead
Because we're all bogged down
And there ain't no fucking SOS
That's going to save our sinking ship
Because we're all bogged down
And no there ain't no fucking SOS
That's going to save our sinking ship

In the ash of your city lies fertile ground

In the ash of your city lies fertile ground

This nation's burning burning down

This nation's burning to the ground
This is the modern Rome burning
Let it burn
This is the modern Rome burning
Let it burn
This is the modern Rome burning
Let it burn
Let it burn
This is New York burning this is Boston burning
This is Omaha burning this is Washington burning
This is Pittsburgh burning this is Birmingham burning

I must again sing my dissent until your end
I must again sing my dissent until your end
We all have our vices we all have our flaws
We all have our anger we all have our love
We all have our vices we all have our flaws
We all have our anger we all have our love
This is the first set of words that I'll put to these chords
To indemnify me of the blood that runs
Through the veins in my arms
Pumped from my heart
That holds hope in one chamber and hate in the others
We all have our vices we all have our flaws
We all have our anger we all have our love
Fatherless is how I prefer to be known
At 6 years young I was left all on my own
The son of a full time working mother
With a molester for father who lives with a prison for home
We all have our vices we all have our flaws
We all have our anger we all have our love
We all have one love
And I must again sing my dissent until your end
And I must again sing my dissent until your end
Because I can barely breathe with your weight on my chest
And I'm so fucking sick of being ashamed of my own flesh
And I must again sing my dissent until your end
We all have our vices we all have our flaws
We all have our anger we all have our love
We all have our vices we all have our flaws
We all have our anger we all have our love
We all have our vices we all have our flaws
We all have our anger we all have our love
We all have our vices we all have our flaws
We all have our anger we all have our love
We all have our vices we all have our flaws
We all have our anger we all have our love
We allHey tonight tonight tonight I'm gonna stay awake
Safe inside this Trojan horse until day breaks
Tear it up tear it up fuck it up
In the streets runs a river knee deep
Hidden in the blood of our own lies the alphabet of the free
As I walk through the valley in the shadow of the dead
Will you remember them
As I walk through the valley in the shadow of the dead
Will you remember them
Ce soir ce soir ce soir je vais rester veill
There is no extinguishing the resistance you betray
The marquis zapatista white rose
Can we see the end of a battle unheard
For every name in history there are a thousand more interred
As I walk through the valley in the shadow of the dead
Will you remember them
As I walk through the valley in the shadow of the dead
Will you remember
I can't believe my own eyes I've seen this sight 1000 times
I can't believe my own eyes I've seen this sight 1000 times
I can't believe my own eyes I've seen this sight 1000 times
I can't believe my own eyes hey
We will be sovereign in the water in the shadow of the dead
Still no one remembers them
We will be free in the cold of the shadow of the dead
You will remember then
As I walk through the valley in the shadow of the dead
Will you remember them
As I walk through the valley in the shadow of the dead
Will you remember them
As I walk through the valley in the shadow of the dead
Will you rememberHow can we be free
The bloodline of kings in the house of white
Lynch law abiding citizens cashing in their rights
The sky is on fire the sky is on fire
It's blood red and torching any horizon it desires
Spit in the face of the deceased
Bite down on your tongue and turn the other cheek
Spit in the face of the deceased
Disappear like a ghost when we pass on the street
Spit spit spit in the face
No I don't give a fuck what you think of me
Are we getting anywhere I'm getting out of here
How can we be free
Abandoning the children in the forest to feed ourselves
We will all stay more healthy if we don't distribute wealth
Aimed friendly fire aimed friendly fire
There is only greed living the life we desire
Spit in the face of the deceased
Bite down on your tongue and turn the other cheek
Spit in the face of the deceased
Disappear like a ghost when we pass on the street
Spit spit spit in the face
No I don't give a fuck what you think of me
Are we getting anywhere I'm getting out of here oh
Spit in the face of the deceased
Bite down on your tongue and turn the other cheek
Spit in the face of the deceased
Disappear like a ghost when we pass on the street
Spit spit spit in the face
I don't give a fuck what you think of me
Are we getting anywhere I'm getting out of here
As we set sail across a raging sea

Unconquerable by reality

As we set sail across a raging sea

Unconquerable by reality
I am infallible I am untouchable
Spit in the face of the deceased
Bite down on your tongue and turn the other cheek

Who would Jesus bomb Yeah who would Jesus kill
The double talk is past surreal
The word of god is now the word of hate
War is peace and freedom is the police state
Can't you see the writing on the wall
Democracy lays trampled on the floor
You better believe that
Hell yeah I'm confused for sure what I thought was the New Millennium is 1984
Mr Orwell from the grave adding fresh ink to the page
As the unpresident declares an endless war
Welcome to 1984
Feels like Nazi Germany and Hitler on TV
As the unpresident spews his homophobic speech
Didn't the Allies fought a war to end extremist fascist law
So tell me NOW what the fuck are we fighting for
I just can not take it anymore
Democracy lays trampled on the floor
Man isn't freedom great
Hell yeah I'm confused for sure what I thought was the New Millennium is 1984
Mr Orwell from the grave adding fresh ink to the page
As the unpresident declares an endless war
Now we've got
Armies of peace armed to the teeth delivering death to make the world a better place
So celebrate the weapons spending say a toast to Armageddon raise some hell
We're all headed straight to hell
Hell yeah I'm confused for sure what I thought was the New Millennium is 1984
Mr Orwell from the grave adding fresh ink to the page
As the unpresident declares an endless war
Welcome to 1984My father Michael is a genius
He sees this world the way no one can
He brought me up and he shaped my mind
At the tender youthful age of 9
He said don't take this for the way it is
You better watch out son when you give in
Before you know it the friends you trust
Will have stabbed you in the back he said
If you wanna steal you better learn how to lie
If you wanna live you better not fear how you die
Heaven and hell are just a myth
So you better pay attention to this moment
If you wanna steal you better learn how to lie
If you wanna live you better not fear how you die
Heaven and hell are just a myth
So you better pay attention to this moment
The fine line between genius and insanity
Is one he often treads so patiently
While pigs and bulls will always try to lock the door
A system built to perpetuate
Pushers pushin' dealers dealin' with they can't escape
I got kids and homes to protect
There's no living in this wage that they have set
If you wanna steal you better learn how to lie
If you wanna live you better not fear how you die
Heaven and hell are just a myth
So you better pay attention to this moment
If you wanna steal you better learn how to lie
If you wanna live you better not fear how you die
Heaven and hell are just a myth
So you better pay attention to this moment
Sometimes when my apathy creeps on up from behind me
It reminds me why I moved my TV
Out of the room where I make love in case I might just look up
And see the sky is falling from above see it falling from above
If you wanna steal you better learn how to lie
If you wanna live you better not fear how you die
Heaven and hell are just a myth
So you better pay attention to this moment
If you wanna steal you better learn how to lie
If you wanna live you better not fear how you die
Heaven and hell are just a myth
So you better pay attention to this moment
If you wanna steal you better learn how to lie
If you wanna live you better not fear how you die

Oh yeahHave you ever been alone Transparency
In the middle of millions of others but still somehow unseen
She is across the aisle he's on the floor above
Your neighbor and every prisoner
Each station filled with static broadcasting nothing but noise
Deep inside of each of us
We are the lost the dead and gone the seldom seen
We are the helpless and the hopeless that no one wants to see
We are the lost the dead and gone the seldom seen
We are the helpless and the hopeless that no one wants to see
Have you ever been drowned Transparency
In the water with millions of others but still somehow unseen
She is across the aisle he's on the floor above
Your neighbor and every stranger
Each station filled with static broadcasting nothing but noise
We are the lost the dead and gone the seldom seen
We are the helpless and the hopeless that no one wants to see
We are the lost the dead and gone the seldom seen
We are the helpless and the hopeless that no one wants to
Outside we are alive where is the line the great divide
Outside we are alive where is the line the great divide
Are we dead

Are we gone

Are we dead

Are we gone

Are we dead
Are we moving on
We may fail to see change but we're never gonna fade away
We are the lost the dead and gone the seldom seen
We are the helpless and the hopeless that no one wants to see
We are the lost the dead and gone the seldom seen
We are the helpless and the hopeless that no one wants to see
We will be seen we will be seen we will be seen
We will be seen we will be seen we will be seen
We will be seen we will be seenThe water turned black and it's just getting darker
So be afraid be afraid be very afraid of the coming nightmare
The NeoChristian Theocrats pray on a Sunday afternoon
Then welcome in Pinochet's men to intimidate to kill
All that we know all we know
Be afraid be afraid be afraid be afraid
Be afraid be afraid be very afraid of the coming nightmare
Be afraid be afraid be afraid be afraid
Be afraid be afraid be very afraid of the coming nightmare
So filled with exhilaration and feels like intoxication
There's nothing like a firefight to get your blood pumping
We get off to the rhythm of the trigger and destruction
Fallujah to New Orleans with impunity to kill
We are the hidden fist of the free market
We are the ink we are the quill
What have you learned through the years
What have you learned from your fears
Be afraid be afraid be afraid be afraid
Be afraid be afraid be very afraid of the coming nightmare
Be afraid be afraid be afraid be afraid
Be afraid be afraid be very afraid of the coming nightmare
Water tastes like arsenic feel it pumping coursing in your blood
Your throat gets tight you can't quite breathe
Room spinning kiss your ass goodbye
Now you're off you've been taken on a ride
We've been sold been sold a bill of lies a bill of lies
Be afraid be afraid be afraid be afraid
Be afraid be afraid be very afraid of the coming nightmare
Be afraid be afraid be afraid be afraid
Be afraid be afraid be very afraid of the coming nightmare
Be afraid be afraid be afraid be afraid
Be afraid be afraid be very afraid of the coming nightmare
Be afraid be afraid be afraid be afraid
Be afraid be afraid be very afraid
There's a storm cloud gathering overhead ominous black reigning hell
When it drops jackboot down on your streets
You're gonna pray like hell that you're armed to the teeth
Built on a corporate welfare scam rums field doctrine stealing wealth
Profits so saccharine sweet the wall street bankers weep
As the storm gains strength the aging levees break
The ancient ground does quake
And your lungs fill with your spineless apathyYou'll get yours when you're good 'n' ready
You'll get yours and go straight to hell
And when that day comes you can be good and sure
The day belongs to us
You'll get yours when you're good 'n' ready
You'll get yours and go straight to hell
And when that day comes you can be good and sure
The day belongs to us
The sign said Detour so I did
And I found myself in a wonderful place
Fields of green when the wind blows cold
The kindda place one could grow old
The sky opened up

The sun showered down

Onto a row of wooden pikes
What an awe inspiring sight
Birds shy on top of them
Puts your head in a beautiful state
You'll get yours when you're good 'n' ready
You'll get yours and go straight to hell
And when that day comes you can be good and sure
The day belongs to us
You'll get yours when you're good 'n' ready
You'll get yours and go straight to hell
And when that day comes you can be good and sure
The day belongs to us
Life is a horror show and baby it will never stop
They tell me watch my step
I answer back You watch your mouth
So many stories you have told
You and your stories have grown old
S O S who will save our ship
S O S who gives a shit
Sinking like a rock with a heart of coal
Sinking like a rock without a soul
Please note don't underestimate
'Cause I'm a cruel motherfucker
You'll get yours when you're good 'n' ready
You'll get yours and go straight to hell
And when that day comes you can be good and sure
The day belongs to us
You'll get yours when you're good 'n' ready
You'll get yours and go straight to hell
And when that day comes you can be good and sure
The day belongs to us
The new dawn starts this day
As strange and savage poetry make up your eulogy
Tables turned around and turned on you
No one sheds a tear no one loses sleep
You disappear

You disappear

You disappear

You disappear

We fall
You'll get yours when you're
You'll get yours when you're
You'll get yours when you're
You'll get yours when you're good 'n' ready
You'll get yours and go straight to hell
And when that day comes you can be good and sure

The day belongs to us
You'll get yours when you're good 'n' ready
You'll get yours and go straight to hell
And when that day comes you can be good and sure

The day belongs to us
No they won't miss you when you're gone
When your heart stops beating and pumping blood
Pull the pin light the fuse
This song's the smartest bomb
You make your own choices and decisions
You are invulnerable to influences
Sit down line up knuckle down shut up
An electrifying organized crime
With planes and boats and suicide
Sit down line up knuckle down shut up
You're so in control
You're so disposable
30 second spot video game
Memory erased magnet over tape
Sit down line up knuckle down shut up
Get psyched up listen to Godsmack
Dip you toes in the sands of Iraq
Sit down line up knuckle down shut up
You're so in control
You're so disposable
No they won't miss you when you're gone
When your heart stops beating and pumping blood
Pull the pin light the fuse
This song's the smartest bomb
No they won't miss you when you're gone
When your heart stops beating and pumping blood
Pull the pin light the fuse
This song's the smartest bomb
Every day we've been taught to follow
Every day lettered to live one way
There is no one left to acknowledge
There is nothing left to say
Every day we've been taught to follow
Every day lettered to live one way
There is nothing left to mention
There is nothing left to say
Kill tonight
Will you follow
Kill tonight
Will you follow
Kill tonight
Will you follow
Kill tonight
Will you follow
Kill tonight
Will you follow
Kill tonight

Kill
No they won't miss you when you're gone

When your heart stops beating and pumping blood

Pull the pin light the fuse

This song's the smartest bomb
No they won't miss you when you're gone

When your heart stops beating and pumping blood

Pull the pin light the fuse

This song's the smartest bomb
This song's the smartest bombLike a ghost emptiness haunted his years
Still his heart was made of nothing less than good oh
Insecure narrative in his head something less than schizophrenia
Creeping him with every move that he makes breath he takes
A pitiful walk alone to his empty home
Where he'll lay and he'll sleep by himself
Go west young man your future is untold
You can find your dreams on the California Coast
Go west young man your future isn't too far away go
She hates me and I know it because she said so
And I forgot my notebook and my socialist manifesto
Will it be a tragedy or a comedy
The choice is up to you life can lead you along on a leash
Or you can break free and run on your own
Don't waste your life go and live your life
Like it's your last day here on this earth
Go west young man your future is untold
You can find your dreams on the California Coast
Go west young man your future isn't too far away far away
Don't waste your life go and live your life
Like it's your last day here on this earth
Go west young man your future is untold
You can find your dreams on the California Coast
Go west young man your future isn't too far away far away
Go west young man your future is untold
You can find your dreams on the California Coast
Go westI did my best to make it in the world
I plowed by sweat in tears into the fertile
Generation generation generated what was needed
For supply to meet demand
The sun shone bright on the ancient range
Then the promise of the future turned the NeoLiberal Plain
The people's voice shut up shut down abstain
Is it gonna take a martyr to end the charade
They tell you that you're out of luck
While people fall they watch their profits rocket up
SOS this is a global call
You better make a stand
You better make it now
Take back your rights from the IMF World Bank and Monsanto
SOS this is a global call
You better make a stand
You better make it now
Corporatocracy leads to profits to killers
Profits to killers no
Geneva to Washington Cancun to Seoul
The Corporate Welfare State runnin' out of control
The Corpocrats have got the guns but their numbers are few
They can kill democracy but they cannot kill the truth

Step out on the matrix of the corporate slave

Step into the world of the living wage
Not for one not for two not for three or four
But for every single citizen around the fucking world
The people in the fight of our lives
The spark of revolution in a farmers' suicide
SOS this is a global call
You better make a stand
You better make it now
Take back your rights from the IMF World Bank and Monsanto
SOS this is a global call
You better make a stand
You better make it now
Corporatocracy leads to profits for killers

Profits for killers
When they wage war on you you lay asleep
When they poison your food you choose to drink
There's poison in the well
Yeah

Monsanto are killers kkkillers

Syngenta are killers kkkillers

The World Bank are killers kkkillers


The WTO are killers kkkillers

Oh no16 year old girl in a hollow cooped up place
Just looking for some prettiness
But the cuts in her arm don't pay for her very pretty view
In her mind she dreams that she is far away from
The bright lights of America life and death in a sold out 'erica
To live and die in the heart of America where they sell souls
The bright lights of America life and death in a sold out 'erica
To live and die in the heart of America where they sell souls
A concrete city hell

Suburbs that never end

One parent lives in each of them
Passed back and forth the upscrew to escape those bitter homes
He's just one of desperate ranks who can't break free from
The bright lights of America life and death in a sold out 'erica
To live and die in the heart of America where they sell souls
The bright lights of America life and death in a sold out 'erica
To live and die in the heart of America where they sell souls
I just want you to know
There are white houses full of fucked up kids like you and me

So many lost in stride caught in an endless fight
To leave this empty ugly place
I'm leaving USA
The bright lights of America life and death in a sold out 'erica
To live and die in the heart of America where they sell souls
The bright lights of America life and death in a sold out 'erica
To live and die in the heart of America where they sell souls

As strange and savage poetry make up your eulogy
Tables turned around and turned on you
No one sheds a tear
No one loses sleep
You disappear
We fall asleep
You disappearWhen all you need was a little motivation
They pointed fingers and yelled dead generation
When all you need was a little care
You get nothing but an old white hair bland stare
Have you ever needed an ounce of love
And all you got was a whole lot of fucked
So say your prayers
It's the death of a nation
Say your prayers
For the dead generation
Condescending broad generalizations
Get real real fast
Just because most hippies and their parents have sold out
Doesn't mean that you your children and their kids won't last
So say your prayers
It's the death of a nation
Say your prayers
For the dead generation
So say your prayers
It's the death of a nation
Say your prayers
For the dead generation
Aggressiveness is godliness
Combativeness is holiness
Destructiveness is faithfulness
Deadliness is devoutness
Praying to a God that they created
And know damn well does not exist
We'll find them on their kneesHey go
We've run out of patience
You've run out of time
This scene will not fall victim
To your violence or lies
Your values are nothing
But excuses to start fights
Quit fronting like you're standing
For a moral cause tonight
United as one
We won't stand aside
You tried to fuck with our scene
We're gonna fuck your life
This machine this machine
This machine this machine
Kills fucking fascists
Dead that's right dead
You don't have to be a racist
To be a Nazi fuck
Your mindless nationalism
Gives you credentials enough
You spew your right wing rhetoric
When we got your attention
You've mistaken the punk scene
For the Republican Convention
No more infiltration
No more right wing lies
You don't belong in our scene
We'll fight you till we die
This machine this machine
This machine this machine
Kills fucking fascists
Dead ahh dieThat alarm clock ringin' in your ear
Radio playing sports report cheer
But you got nothing to cheer or shout about
Just a nine to five in a lousy town
Your morning begins
With you thinkin' of the cold of the street blown' in your face
Your morning begins with you thinkin'
One more day in this job and I'm gonna scream
So stand up
And step out
Step out to the new sound
Hello to the manager Hello to the boss
As they sell you short and they drink your blood
You give 'em your heart and your very soul
Only to realize that they don't give a fuck about you
Your morning begins
With you thinkin' of the cold of the street blowing in your face
Your morning begins with you thinkin'
One more day in this life and I'm gonna scream
So stand up
Step out
Step out to the new sound
And when they try to put you down put you on your back
But you don't take that you knock 'em outthe national media cover clintonlewinsky
while the world's governments sell out millions on the issue of free trade
but somewhere in the night  a force is not asleep
ad a massive organization plans to rise up to its feet
it happens like this
a pirate radio voice transmite into the night
and from DC to Peking email warns of lost global rights
and the hoax the world's leaders wanted no one to see
comes crashing on their heads from grass roots  striking it down
the blows coming for the world's
chorus
underground network  alternative communication
corporate media can't keep us beat down brainwashed enslaved
'cause of our underground network  alternative communication
they try to blind us but we
stand up and fight stnad up and fight
they try to keep us ignorant but we
stand up and fight stand up and fight
they want to take our rights away so
stand up and fight fightI'm standing with the ranknfile
I'm marching with the underground
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves
Let my imagination go and drop me where I feel most scare
Back snap back already giving thanks I'm not trapped working
In a sweatshop somewhere
This songs for those less fortunate
Locked in a world where both ends aren't meant to meet
I'm standing with the ranknfile
I'm marching with the underground
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves
I'm standing with the ranknfile
I'm marching with the underground
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves
Let my imagination go and drop me where I feel most scare
Synaptic flashes in my head then total thanks again
I'm not soldiering somewhere
This songs for the countless souls
Who died in vain for someone else's gain
I'm standing with the ranknfile
I'm marching with the underground
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves
I'm standing with the ranknfile
I'm marching with the underground
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves
Left my birthplace for foreign streets
To strange places new faces I flew
Shoe less kids stood on the corner
Their eyes they were transfixed on you
So I'm standing with the ranknfile
I'm marching with the underground
My black heart worn on the my sleeve
I'm standing with the ranknfile
I'm marching with the underground
With our black hearts worn on our sleeves
Alright
I'm standing with the ranknfile
I'm marching with the underground
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves
I'm standing with the ranknfile
I'm marching with the underground
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves
I'm standing with the ranknfile
I'm marching with the underground
Our black hearts worn on our sleeves
I'm standing with the ranknfile
I'm marching with the underground
Our black hearts worn on our sleevesYoh
One two
One two three four
Hey
Look back on history nothing much has changed
Thousands of soldiers of all countries all marching the same
Every nation's leader says that our side is right
Every nation's leader says the time has come to fight
But they use the common people to settle their scores
It's time that we refuse to fight in any of their wars
We're looking to start a new army
Too smart to fight too smart to die
We're looking to start a new army
Too smart to fight too smart to kill for you for you
One two three four one two three four
One two three four one two three four
One two three four one two three four
One two three four four
Join now the ranks of all nations who refuse to go to war
Refuse to pull the trigger of a gun for leaders 'round the world
I'd rather fight to spread some tolerance and unity
Than buy into their nationalistic brainwashing
Killing mothers fathers sisters brothers
Common human beings not savages but people like you like me
We're looking to start a new army
Too smart to fight too smart to die
We're looking to start a new army
Too smart to fight too smart to kill
We're looking to start a new army
Too smart to fight too smart to die
We're looking to start a new army
Too smart to fight too smart to kill for you for you
We're looking for a few good men
We're looking for a few good women
Who are not afraid to fight against tyranny
But who refuse to fight with tyranny tyranny oh oh oh oh
Refuse refuse refuse refuse refuse refuse refuse refuse
Refuse refuse refuse refuse refuse refuse refuse refuse
We're looking to start a new army
Too smart to fight too smart to die

Power to the peaceful
Power to the peaceful oh

This is not a war of the urging people
This is not a war of economic independence

But the more things change
The more they stay the same
Back stabbing and name calling
The trade marks of your act
You talk and talk of unity
But divide with your attacks
I'd like to see a change I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change but I'm too busy
Tearing everyone down tearing everyone down stop
And all us kids we try to make a change
Some kids start a band others start a zine
You no matter what your path
You throw a curve in what could be achieved
Then give up and move onto some other thing
I'd like to see a change I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change but I'm too busy
Tearing everyone down tearing everyone down
Take a break from your fights
Try to open up your mind tonight
When you feel that's complete
We can tackle this society
You may not like everything in life I do
But that doesn't mean I'm not trying to change
The same problems as you
I'd like to see a change I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change but I'm too busy come on
Tearing everyone down tearing everyone down
Tearing everyone down down down down down down
Tearing everyone down down down down down down
Tearing everyone downHe knows he'll be alone tonight
While contemplating what can I do
Lack of hope leaves him feeling violent
It's not that he's looking for a fight it's just
He don't know where to turn
More stress than help from home and school
And on the streets his life's out of control
Angry young and poor angry young and pissed
Angry no one cares oh
Angry young and poor angry young and pissed
Angry no one cares no
She never need another chance mental sexual physical violence
Not once she heard an encouraging word

So her life became something so out of control
Angry young and poor angry young and pissed
Angry no one cares oh
Angry young and poor angry young and pissed
Angry no one cares no
Don't know where to turn
Don't know what to do
Angry young and poor angry young and pissed
Angry no one cares no

Angry no one cares no
Don't know where to turn
Don't know what to do

Oh Carolyn

In a world of gray
And when darkness takes over
You light my way
And I am positive a word from you can spark a dead life to a new start

I wish I could see the world through your eyesI said a lot of things
Some things I didnt mean
Some things I wish you could forget
I tried a million times
And never got it right
Now all I got left
Is staring at the ceiling ya another night
Carrying the feelings of a long goodbye
Wishing that the shadows would leave me alone
My heart is tired and I need you girl so
Oh oh oh baby come back to me
Oh oh oh baby come back to me
I heard your moving on
Signing a different song
Than the one we use to have
I tried to pick them up
The pieces of our love
I hope its not to late for that
Staring at the ceiling ya another day
Carrying these feelings while i waste away
Wishing that the shadows would leave me alone
My heart is tired and i need you girls so
Oh oh oh baby come back to me
Oh oh oh baby come back to me
Will it ever get better than this
Ya its gotta get better than thins

You look around you look around
Searching for the closest exit cause you can't handle all the pressure
I feel you letting go but don't let go
If you run
I'll follow you wherever you go
Until you find your way back home
Love is here love is here
You're not alone I'll hold you when the nights are cold
I will never let you go
Love is here I'll be here
Until you find your way back home
Pushing pulling still there's no movement you're on the edge of breaking down
But don't breakdown no
There's a light burning inside that taught you to fight and don't quit trying
I'll be here yes I'll be here
If you run
I'll follow you wherever you go
Until you find your way back home
Love is here love is here
You're not alone I'll hold you when the nights are cold
I will never let you go
Love is here I'll be here
Until you find your way back home
Until you find your way back home 
I'll be here until you find your way backShe wakes up to face the cold world
Full of empty words she'll prolly get hurt
She doesn't wanna be a big star
The flashy lights or the fast cars
She volunteers down at the welfare
Where spends a lot of time cause no one else cares
They out chasing them fast cars
Yeah they wanna be big stars
But just a little smile goes a long long way
If you need me im coming
Just hold on im running
Just let your love shine out
No matter the colour
We're sister and brothers
Just let your love shine out
Hes feeling low lifes out of control
Like a traffic sign he on stop he cant go
On his knees he prays real hard
Only time can heal these scars
Holding a sign just begging for a buck
Yeah he needs a little help or someone he can trust
On his knees he prays real hard
Dont leave me you done brought me this far
Just a little smile goes a long long way
If you need me im coming
Just hold on im running
Just let your love shine out
No matter the colour
We're sister and brothers
Just let your love shine out
Sing it out as loud as you can
I love ya I love ya
Sing it out as loud as you can
I love ya I love ya
If you need me im coming
Just hold on im running
Just let your love shine out
No matter the colour
We're sister and brothers
Just let your love shine outI wish I wish I wish I wish for you
I wish I wish I wish I wish for you
I wish you were always with a smile
I wish you were happy all the while
I wish you were never in despair
And life could be a sweet affair
I wish that my love could bring to you
Happiness and joy to cling to you
All the things that gives a lover's wings
Are all the things I wish for

I wish somehow we could always be
Finding sunshine hiding misery
I wish someday we would never part
And love would start from heart to heart
All these happy things I wish for you
All the wondrous things and dreams we knew
Living loving things that lovers do
They do come true my wishes


I'm the one you done heard all the rumors about
You vibrate like my cellie how you movin around
In that new gear fresh off the Lesiango runway
Lets go to StBarts Sunday to Sunday
Your nails done and them braids all twisted
If you got a flaw I guess I just missed it
I'm not easy to reach my digits unlisted
Come closer but don't stain with your lipstick

Been around the world
Seen so many girls
But none have moved me quite the way she does
And I've done some things
With some qhetto queens
It was just for fun but now I think I'm in love
I can't stop thinking 'bout her
She's everywhere that I go does she know I just can't live without her
Whoa she

I can't control how she turns me on so much
Without a single touch

Shorty your the one

'Cause you're my favorite girl
In the whole wide world

Now I'm in XXL its so funny
High Schools double my sales I'm gettin money

Can't stop thinking 'bout her
She's everywhere that I go does she know I just can't live without her
Whoa she

Without a single touch

All alone and lookin' pretty
Listening to the music that we played
She walked up and whispered
I leaned down and listened
To the request that she made
Do you know 'You Are My Sunshine'
She asked so sweet and tenderly
Do you know 'You Are My Sunshine'
And would you do it one more time for me
Border to border
And ocean to ocean
I still look for her everplace
Chasing the sunshine
Each and every night I'm
Searching every crowd for her face
She was gone just as quick
As the song that she asked for

Since it sparked off you my next ta kin
Is it your silky skin
Ya' innocent grin
Or them curves and tha way that chu' been
Whatever it is you got me glad that I took notice
When times hopeless
Your words helped me stay focused
I was once told never trust a diva
I usually toss 'em like the crust of a pizza
But now my sixth sense tell me ta keep her
We livin' lavida
In our own world like cita
I'll let you sport mah chain rock mah hat
Wear mah jersey watch mah back
It took a lot for you to earn my trust
You wanna roll wit a boss
Then trust is a must
So lets skip all the fightin' and fuss
Forget about them it's us
Girl it's us nothing's gon' change it that's a fact
Even if ya' girls ain't down for that
And even if the fellas ain't got my back
It's us nothing's gon' change it that's a fact
Nomatter what they say we'll try
And even if the hate we'll ride
They say you get what you pay for
That's why I'd rather pay more
And keep you in them wears shortys slice ya' face for
They get tha knock off's you get the real Louis
That's one of the benefits of gettin' close to me
Down for three years ain't nuttin come between
Expirienced things you never thought you woulda' seen
I took you off the scene
Sold you a dream
You bought that wit out no cream
We a match made like george and weezie
Lucy and ricky ike and tina bobby and whitney
And if shit hit the fan you comin' wit me
I won't take the stand they gotta' come and get me
Ain't no limit to what I would do
Cause true love strikes only one in a few
You might think it's too good to be true
But it ain't up to me it's up to you
Girl it's us nothing's gon' change it that's a fact 
Even if ya' girls ain't down for that
And even if the fellas ain't got my back 
It's us nothing's gon' change it that's a fact

And we're gonna keep it together
I'll be lovin' you forever
Boy I want you know you make me so happy I'll never leave your side not for a minute

Nomatter if they gossipin' out loud or whisperin'

Don't let this moment past you byI was floating through the cemetery late last night
When I saw a ghost who was outta sight
He said 'Down in the graveyard there's a party going on
So get down six feet
And sing a spiritual song
Everyone's invited we would be delighted
If you grabbed your favourite corpse and came along'

You don't move your arms and don't move your legs
You just do the Dead Elvis
You don't grind your pelvis it's the dance of the dead
You just do the Dead Elvis
Your old hound dog's sniffin' at your tomb
Tryin' to find a bone that ain't been consumed
You can't jailhouse rock in your blue suede shoes
You just do the Dead Elvis
I bet you're lonesome tonight in your hole in the ground
Old Shep's all shook up and he's pissed on your crown
No one's crying in the chapel so get wise 
There's some pretty heavy shit going down and you're it
Priscilla was delighted
All Dallas was invited
To poke fun a your corpse and kick your dog

It was a terrible day when you had your cardiac arrest
They tried to find your heart but couldn't cut through the flesh
You can't Viva Las Vegas when there's no viva left
You just do do do
The Dead Elviiiiiiiiis
You're dead ElvisSkippy's all grown up he's not a joey anymore
He's interested in getting pissed and passing out on the floor Oi
He glassed Mat Hammond with a bottle of stout
And threw a dart in Sonny's eyes before he ripped it out
Who's that walking on air
Bouncing down the street without a care
It's skin head Skippy the killer kangaroo Oi
With blood soaked bovver boots and a racist attitude
A mean fucking mother's son
Not afraid of anyone
Got the others on the run
Here he comes here he comes
Skippy the skin Oi
Tch tch tch tch tch Oi
Skippy's got a tattoo and he's gone and shaved his head
He's dating wallabies half his age
And getting them into bed
He says his old friends are all miserable pricks
They're married now or dead and gone
Or mentally sick
Who's that walking on air
Bouncing down the street without a care
Well Benji got the snip and tuck and now he's sniffing glue
oh shit that's great Flicka
Milo and Otis died at least eight times over
aah woof meow oh ah doh oh  that's eight
Rin Tin Tin blindly humps the leg of his owner
Hey Rin Tin Tin what's that tune
Last Post Damn splinter Ow
Flipper became sushi
Mr Ed loves drag
Lassie's a transvestite
And Gentle Ben Gentle Ben's a fag
Who's causing havoc on the docks
In a pair of bright red braces and cherry red docs
It's skin head Skippy the fascist kangaroo
With a blood soaked Stanley knife
And a racist attitude
He'll wait until you're all alone
Crack your skull break your bones
Send the pieces to your home
He's the one
All in fun
Skippy the skinhead

The way you flirtify your lips
I hear the zipper unzip
Feel the flesh start to rip rip rip rip rip rip rip rip rip rip rip
You've got to stand up and be counted
Or lie down and be mounted

Transexuals and transvestites

You've got to STOPI Fuck Dogs
In the park at the docks
When the moon is up high in the sky
The great dane is too tall
chiwawa's are to small
but the dog that I like
to quell up at night
'cause the dushhound is best of all
'cause he is longer than he's thinner
he love to let me in
His eyes swell with love
he fits like a glove
and that's why he's man's best friend
I fuck dogs he fucks dogs I fuck dogs we fuck dogs
We all fuck dogs in the park 
She fucks dogs she fucks dogs she fucks dogs she fucks dogs
We all fuck dogs in the park
He's got bed bugs tits and knits
If he scratches then I itch
but The kennel is cramped and though he's a scamp
life with a dog is a bitch
You'll never be alone if you give the dog a bone
and the pee wee don't kiss but the problem is this
His bark 
is worse than his bite

furball
is worse than his bite
I fuck dogs
in the park
after the dock
when the moon is up high in the sky
and I'm not proudI love a girl called Maria
Her name is Maria
They call her Mari Mari
Mari Mari Maria
She loves a guy who's a maori
A New Zealand maori
Yes he's a maori maori
Maori maori maori
They sailed
A kayak down the Murray
A kayak down the Murray
Down the Murray
Murray Murray Murray
They docked
at the marina
at the marina
mari mari mari
mari mari marina
They love pasta marinara
Pasta marinara
They love their mari
Mari mari marinara
They skipped
Through a field of marigolds
A field of marigolds
A field of mari
Mari mari marigolds
They said
One day they would marry
One day they would marry
Yes they'd marry
Marry marry marry marry
Sadly they DIED this afternoon
CHACHACHAAnd I'll tell you while I'm able
Or I'll smash your skull if you're not
Drink enough Black label
It's a hard mans drink
And though the bottles broken
Put your money on the table
Strain the glass through your teeth
So we grew up mean lean
Kings of the street scene
Without a mothers guiding hand
To keep us clean
Down your rum
We'll take life as it comes
And all you blue rinse critics
Lick our literary bums
I drank my first pure malt
Before I was three
I smoked a pack of Dutch cigarettes
My pappy left for me
And I romanced a little lass
Who was twelve years my elder
At the age of six I held her
That year I also bed her
So before I was seven
My first child was born
I told a pack of filthy lies
As a politician
I heard my own confession
As an act of contrition
I spent ten years as a Trappist monk
In a village in Tibet
And I walked up Everest naked
Just to win a bet
Well I cut off my leg
To win a one legged race
And when I won I stitched it
on my little sister's stomach
I've fought Mohammed Ali
I've seduced Mata Hari
I've even worn a sari
When I impersonated Ghandi
And I dare any man here
To call me a liar

But I swear I've seen Ezekial
I swear I've seen Isiah
Toasting marshmellows
In Beelzebub's fire
And we're mad mad mad
Dangerous to know
We never give a tinkers cuss
About the seeds we sow
And we stay up late
And never be forlorn
And when the morning comes around
We'll kiss the crack of dawn
We took the whacks from Kerouac's
And dusty Dostoyevsky's
And when all was said and done
Booze was all I had left me
For all the worlds great thinkers
Are all a looooaaaaaooooaaad of pus
And if you ask us how Zarathustra spoke
He spake thus
Drink drink drink
Drink until you're drunk
Drink until you can't stand up
'til you're rolypoly stunk
'til your bladder bursts
'til you throw a fit to curse
'til they lift you up still comatose
And slamdance in the hearse
We're good good bad bad
Ugly as sin
We mix up cough syrup
With our gin
So take your medicine
I pray that when I die
There's someone else around
To kiss my arse goodbye
Yes I pray I pray I pray that when I die
There's someone else around to kiss my arse goodbyeMoral Dilemmas Just answer these questions in your own minds and in

And I will raise you from your sleep
I will kiss you in four places
As I go running up your street
And I will squeeze the life out of you
And you will make me laugh and make me cry
And we may never forget it
You will make me call your name
And I'll shout it to the blue summer sky
And we may never meet again
So shed your skin and lets get started
And you may throw your arms around me
Yeah you may throw your around me
Well I came for you at night time
And I watched you in your sleep
Lord I met you in high places
I kissed your head and kissed your feet
Now if you disappear out of view
You know that I will never say goodbye
And though I try and forget it
You will make me call your name and I'll shout it to the blue summer sky
And we may never meet again
So shed your skin and lets get started
And you may throw your arms around me

Can we walk hand in hand through the park
We'll whisper sweet nothings and love sonnets by the bard
It's a love I'll know will always last
If we walk hand in hand through the park
Shall we stroll along the promenade
I shall buy you icecream treats and shield you from the sun
My heart beats louder than Venus did for Mars
Shall we stroll along the promenade
Me lord High executioner
Can you staplegun my genitals to the wall
I wouldn't normally beg but I've been a trifle tense
We could both have a ball
If you staplegun my genitals to the wallI met her at the 'Sailor Arms'
A bar down by the docks
Full of prostitutes and deviants
And fellows wearing frocks
Went there to drown my sorrow
My misery and paaaiiiiaaaiiiiaan
With fourteen multicoloured pills
And a pint of heavy ale

And I saw this girl across the way
Who was smiling through the wine
So I begged her come on over
Come on over spend some time
And I spilled my life before her
And she seemed to understand
Although she was a girl
We were talking man to man


For love is where you find it
Wherever that may be
For me it was in the Sailors Arms
At twentyfive past three
There's something strange about her
I can't put my finger on
But I wanna tell the world
That she's the one

I wanna tell the world
That she's the one
She strolled up to the toilets
She strolled into the Gents
I asked her why she did it
Why she'd gone to pay the rent
We armwrestled and I lost
She beat me with a spike
Told me filthy jokes
That were quite unladylike

It was four in the morning
And through the smokey haze
I could've been mistaken
But she needed to shave


For love is where you find it
Wherever that may be
For me it was in the Sailors Arms
With a better man than me
Her husky voice seduced me
My heart was in a mess
I sat upon her knee
As something twitched beneath her dress
There's something more than knees beneath her dress
You've got nice eyes says I

What large hands I said

God you arms look strong

Your legs are quite hirsuite

I was feeling less than stable
When she said her name was Ken

Well if I had suspicions
Lord I should've had 'em then

She cried as she told me
How she was so confused
One more visit to the doctor
She'd have nothing left to lose

I ran my fingers through her wig
She lightly stroked my hair
She said she was a man
Whoa whoa She said she was a man
A man called Ken  Bulltwang
Lots of men are called Ken

I told her I don't care


For love is where you find it
Wherever that may be
For me it was in a hopper bin
With my trousers 'round my knees
There's something strange about her
I just put my finger on
And I want to tell the world
That she's the one

I want to tell the world
That its the oneIf you're happy and you know it
Wear a dress and pretend you're Margaret Thatcher that's what he doesHi ma I've come back home
'Cause I don't like this world we live in
For all my faults and failures
Please tell me I'm forgiven
I want my old womb back
My cosy cubbyhole
I want to be your child again
Before I get too old
Mummy dearest mother mine
It's me your baby boy
I know what's lacking in your life
That old maternal joy
So lets boil up some water
No need to get a nurse
It'll be just like the virgin birth
But only in reverse
Mummy dearest mother mine
It's me your only son
Freud would have a field day
Trying to understand this one
Let's have a natural reentry
Most doctors say it's easier
But I've brought a butchers knife
Just in case you want a caeser
It's not some old wive's tale
Or some unfortunate wisecrack
But you could use some extra weight
And I need to take a nine month nap
And I've been good I've been good
Now I deserve a small reward
Don't want my birthday suit
I want to wear my umbilical cords
You know the ones with the jumbo flare with the spot of
blood around the cuff
Mummy dearest mother mine
Look what the stork brought back
I don't want no damp bunk bed
I want my foetal sack
I was a sad lonely child
I wish that you'd had twins
And if you can spare the room Ma
I'd like to bring some friends
Mummy dearest mother mine
It's me your pookie bear
I don't want to hurt you
Or soil your underwear
'Cause you're my guru my ma
My host my home my mentor
We could have a three course meal
If we boil up the old placenta

If I asked all the women of the world what it was to be a lesbian
they would be silent oh mother
And yet if I was to ask all the men in 
the
world what it was to be a lesbian

You total sexist bastard get out of our livesI'm wet and I'm moist

And the fact that we are all young adults 
And lie back on your couch
After this there'll be no doubt
I don't care if you're a Miss or a Missus
You done been squelched by the world's best kisses
Ho ho sit up straight and pout

Stand proud and say Hey Mister

A tongue so long it really grows and grows
Put it in your mouth and it'll clean out your nose
I've only kissed one girl before
My Grandma on the kitchen floor
She dribbled and grinned and said Hey Kid
You taught me things your Grandpa never did
She added there'd be hell to pay
If Ma found out we'd gone astray
So hurry Paul go and get some sleep
You finally got a skill to teach the sheep
Hey hey calm down and pucker up
These lips are strong enough to stop a truck
A tongue so long it really packs a punch
One kiss from this
And I'll know what you had for lunch
One kiss from this
And I'll know what you had for lunch
YesterdayAh ah ah

She's a pusher I think you know her
Got my straw found my score

There's a mushroom growin' inside of me
A pill makes you big a pill makes you small
You're so tiny I'm so tall

You're just a pain in the looking glass

You can find romance or piss in your pants

Let's leave it up to fate mate

You're a drunken bore

Let me get this line straight

I've been waiting all night

To powder my nose
Lord don't stop me Thar she blows

In my previous existence I was queen Nepatiti of Egypt

and at the moment I'm a member of the church of latta day channelers
And I'd just like to say
That there ought to be a law against you shooting off your mouth
I don't invite you in but you still get into my house

BAHHHHH
FireSooty's all grown up he's not a puppet anymore
He's interested in getting pissed and passing out on the floor Oi
He glassed Basil Brush with a bottle of stout
And threw a dart in Squeek's eyes before he pulled it out
Who's that walking on air
Bouncing down the street without a care
It's skin head Sooty with the killer xylophone Oi
With blood soaked bovver boots and a racist attitude
A mean fucking mother's son
Not afraid of anyone
Got the others on the run
Here he comes here he comes
Sooty the skin Oi
queek queek queek queek queek Oi
Sooty's got a tattoo and he's gone and shaved his head
He's dating muppets half his age
And getting them into bed
He says his old friends are all miserable pricks
They're married now or dead and gone
Or mentally sick
Who's that walking on air
Bouncing down the street without a care
Well the hunce caught up with Basil Brush and he got clubbed to death

Hey Paul it's enough mate
It's dead mate
mate you've knocked the stuffing out of him
Bill and Ben got little weed and smoked it in the shed
Weed Weed Weed
Blubba that little weed
Zebadee ODed on E and now he's pushing clover
It's not lawn I got it from the womballs
Dougal blindly humps the leg of his owner
I say what's that tune said Dougal
 Ow
bobby is a bigot
the clangers flew away
The thunderbirds are puppets No
And Andy Pandy's Gay
and proud people and proud no strings on end he stands up himself 
these
days
Who's causing havoc on the docks
In a pair of bright red braces and cherry red docs
It's skin head Sooty with the killer xylophone
With a blood soaked Stanley knife
And a racist attitude
He'll wait until you're all alone
Crack your skull break your bones
Send the pieces to your home
He's the one
All in fun
Sooty the skinhead
Oi oi oi oi Oi Oi Oi Oi Oi Oi Oi Oi
I bet you wonderin' how I knew
'bout your planes to make me blue
Whith some other guy you knew before
Between two of us guys you know I love you more
It took me by surprise
I must say
When I found you yesterday
Don't you know that
I heard it through the grapevine
not much longer would you be mine
uhh uhh heard it through the grapevine
Oh I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey honey oh baby
ooh ooh honey honey
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears
I can't hold inside
Losin' you
Would end my life you see
Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you loved someone else
Instead
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Ohh I heard it thought the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey honey
People say believe half of what you see
Oh and none of what your hear
But I can't help but be confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved beforeI don't know much about ART but I can tell you this
Duchamps's Urinal is a piece of piss
Van Gogh cut off his ear to spite his face 
Me I've got a message for the whole human race
I want to be a phallic symbol like the Tower of Pisa
And wipe the smile off smile off the face of that bitch the Mona Lisa
I'll date Botticelli's Venus just to tease her
But unless you're hung like a Jackson Pollock
You couldn't please her
Funk you and funk your mother
Funk your sister funk your auntie
And funk your little brother
When you've learnt how to funk one another
Don't leave that groovy thing on the shelf
Go home to the one you love and
Funk yourself
As Gallileo said And yet it moves
While Oppenheimer splits the atom
And Newton finds the groove
But me I agree with Einstein
Who put it so much simpler
I want it to end as it began
With one BIG BANG not a whimper
Funk you funk quantum physics
When you've proved their theory's wrong
You can go and funk the cynics
Take a proton pill as you buttfunk the critics
You're EMC squared 
Well funk your buddy and
Funk your wife
Sexual psychology fasinates me more than art or science
I've attempted intercourse with every household appliance
A girl came to my clinic I guess you'd call her a client
She wouldn'y shake my hand which I found so defiant
I said My Psychoanalyst is gonna love you
'Cause you look just like my sister
She said But I've got no arms
And armless girls cannot play twister
She tried to take my pants off with her teeth
But her stiff upper lip got caught in the metal zip
Funk you and funk your mother
Funk your sister funk your auntie
And funk your little brother
When you've learnt how to funk one another
Don't leave that groovy thing on the shelf
Go home to the one you love and
Home to the one you love and
Home to the one you love and
Funk yourselfWith a downward blast
From his doughy arse
Like a lance of fire
He shot up the mast
As he mumbled blasphemous epitaphs
I am the sailor
And the captain cried with a mighty heaveho
Enemy sighted on the starboard bow
Load your cannons and let 'em go
For God is on our side boys
In the dust and sand
Of a foreign land
With hands afire
He buried his friend
He beat his brow
As he foully said
I am the soldier
And the private laughed as he reached the bluff
His gun barrel smoking Enough's enough
We've done more damage than old MacDuff
And God is full of pride boys
He flew through the flak
On the first attack
A bomb bay open
On a missile's back
Here's the payload
He crudely spat
I am the airman
And the general sighed This is our last stand
Let every man say 'Amen'
For we'll not see daylight again
And tonight we meet our God boys
Well the airman plunged into the pine
And the sailor drowned in the briny brine
And the soldier in haste put his foot on a mine
And it comes to all in time boys
For on the day they died boys
God was on the other side boysHey we got a job outta the way
from Salt Lake City to San Francisco overnight
Been a long drive man

We was bored of all the waitin'
Me and Bill was up in the front

Gonna rock that Ranch baby
Gets in the way you breathe
Now Bill got the finest one in the house
She came out the back all in her underwear
lookin' fine and he was jealous
She took him by the hand
and he went back to the jungle room
And his teeth were chattin'
And he was sweating bullets
Cause he was so damn scared
And she sat him down on the couch
Put her hand on his leg
And said Whatchu wanna do to me
He said I want my ham to be glazed
She said How much money you got
He said Twenty dollars
She said

My whole life has changed
Since I met you baby
My whole life has changed
And everybody tells me
That I'm not the same
Since I met you baby
I'm just happy as can be
Since I met you baby
All my troubles fade away
And everybody tells me
That I'm not the same
I don't need no doctor
To tell my troubles to
And I don't need nobody
To tell my troubles to
'Cause since I met you baby
All I need is you
'Cause since I met you baby
All I need is you

What you say


Woah Woman oh woman don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen

Cause I'll be back on my feet some day

You can't mean that

Oh now baby please

What you tryin' to do to me

Oh don't treat me like that
As I sit around watchin' the rain come down
It puts me in the mood
It reminds me of the first time I met you girl
And I hear the rain on the windowpane
And it brings back memories
Of the love we made
And the things that we used to do
Yes and I recall the thrill of it all
When the heat had just begun
Everything was fine nothing never did go wrong
We had a strong love affair strong love affair baby
From the very start
We had a strong love affair strong love affair baby
Then you broke my heart
I didn't know what to do
After lovin' you
And I couldn't get a real good start
We had a strong love affair strong love affair baby
And I' m still missing you a lot
So when I hear rain it just brings back pain
You gave the best love I ever had
It's a doggone shame 'cause it sure felt good to me
Sometimes I wonder where did you disappear to
How did you get away baby
And I often think of you
Do you ever think of me baby
Sometimes love don't work the way you think it should
When your love jones comes on down baby
But baby I still care and I think that I always will
We had a strong love affair strong love affair baby
From the very start
We had a strong love affair strong love affair baby
Then you broke my heart
I didn't know how to act
After your bags were packed
And I couldn't get a real good start
We had a strong love affair strong love affair baby
And I'm still lovin' you a lot oh wellWell I heard about the fellow you've been dancin' with All over the neighbourhood
So why didn't you ask me baby

It's hard enough alone well you should know
The scars you never showed me
Your eyes that turned away
Angelina to God for you I prayed
Angelina I often heard you weep
At times I'd stay awake and watch you sleep
Your innocence would move me
At times you've made me scared
Angelina my love for you I cared
Angelina in silence you would speak
A simple touch of you and I grew weak
You finally let me hold you
The day before you died
Angelina my angel in the sky
You finally let me hold you
The day before you died
Angelina my angel in the skySay no more
I think you'll never understand
I have refused the same demand
All my life
Say no more
In my book there can be no blame
When you pretend I have no shame
You're half right
All along
You kept trying to pin me down
Turn me into your house clown
If I don't fit the bill
All the same
I loved you then
I love you still

Want to know the truth
I caught a nasty bug
And when it got a hold of me
I could not shake it free
A lasting blue note
Has been haunting me
It's like an old mistress
Forever chasing me
But say no more
I may not be an easy man
But the way you played your hand
I couldn't stand
It's too bad
There is much more we could have done
But now those days are dead and gone
Nothing lasts
All along
You made me feel this useless guilt
Can you look back on what we built
I wonder what you saw in me
Tell me was it real
Was it love
You tell me

And though you think of it
As the cause of my fall
Never mind I'm blessed I'm here at allOne more time
Please let me hold you one more time
Before you walk away my dear
Please let me hold you near
I love you dear
So let me kiss you one more time
Please let me kiss you one more time
I know I'm gonna miss you so
My darling when you go
I'll miss you so so
So let me stay my dear
For just another moment or two
Then I'll have
The memory of you
To see me though so
So let me hold you one more time
And let me kiss you one more
That's all I'll ever ask of you
Unless you say that you
Still love me too
For maybe one more time 
Is all I need 
Just one more time 
And maybe you will see that I'm 
Your one and only love
Let me stay for just another moment
A moment a moment or two
Then I'll have the memory of you
To see me through

So let me hold you one more time
And let me kiss you one more time
That's all I'll ever ask of you
Unless you say that you
Still love me too
For maybe one more time 
Is all I need 
Just one more time 
And maybe you will see that I'm
Your one and only love 
Your one and only love 
Your one and only love 
One more timeShould I've been a ghost
It would suited
Filling in the gaps
To keep it out of me
You're the one that we fear most
You do it all the time
But it's building up inside
And now there's something Walking over you
All over you
Living monochrome
And all you do is bad to love
Waiting by the side of those
Rusty railroad tracks
That take you to a place
A place you've never been before before
Never coming back
Never looking back
Anymore
Now all your love is gone
All your love is gone
Cuz all your love is gone
All your love is gone
Now I see
And now it's clear
That you're just like me
That you're just like me
Cuz all my love is gone
All my love is gone
Cuz all my love is gone
And all my love is gone

Humblest of thanks for stepping in my section

Bombass shit got ya feelin' kinda hazy
I stay punk rock miz it with the hiphop
Bounce in the lowlow better feel the shit drop
With fifteen minutes to lay down the track
You can't step to this shit cuz all your shit's whack
And if a killer beat is pumpin' through your stereo
Better crank this shit so the whole world can hear it yo
And you can catch me sittin' chillin in a BK
Munchin' on a cheeseburger sippin' on a milkshake
I do it cuz I love it I love it when the beat drop
And I love the fact that I never had a real job
You're talkin' shit with critical eyes
But I'll see you in an hour for my burger and fries
Behind the counter with your paper hat
While I get paid to live it up what you think about that
I'm the contender I rock the party
Catch me with your girlfriend when she's feelin' naughty
I got the power I got the skill
Cocky as a motherfucker dressed to kill
And every single night we gettin' it on
Rock the shit let it rip and do another one
These kids hang on every single word that we spoke
Man fuck that shit I'm still just a kid and I'm fuckin' broke

Can't sit still cuz I'm addicted to the caffeine
Still rockin' out for all the kids
Still broke as fuck but I'm lovin' this shit
I don't care if you front and hate
Cuz I'm gettin' pussy while you masturbate
You talk trach too much you need to shut up
Because you sound like a bitch homie no one gives a fuck
About your friends your car your daddy's cash
What's it like livin' lif suckin' dick and kissin' ass
When you hang around with your preppy friends
Pointin' fingers talkin' shit and takin' it in the rear end
You think we're a joke but you don't seem to know
We got these kids bouncin' all over the motherfucking globe
Yeah we're gettin' respect hell yeah for sure
But I'm still white trash and I'm still fuckin' brokeI was a young kid with an attitude
Shoulda got kicked out of my middle school
I was such a dick I was such a jerk
Never paid attention and I never did my work
Didn't listen got kicked out of class
Cuz I told my english teacher that she smelled like ass
The only thing that mattered everyday
Was getting out at 2 o'clock and getting laid
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
You say fuck me I say fuck you too
Cuz I don't have to listen to you
Don't give me no shit don't hassle me
Cuz my daddy pays your salary
Sixth grade I think my teacher was a crackhead
Cuz he always liked to make kids cry
He was married to the school's gym teacher
She was a woman but looked like a guy
Eight grade my teacher was the worst
Get a C minus get beaten with a purse
Every word of this is a true story
Come to my town and see it
It's fucked and boringI'm gonna kill Santa Claus

Santa gonna be decapitated in his workshop while he's masturbating
All the little kids on Santa Claus lane gonna see his head impaled on a candy cane
Making my list and checkin' it twice and I don't give a shit if he's naughty or nice
Comin' at Santa with a chainsaw kick down the door and cut his fucking head off
Santa Claus gonna be dead
Cuz I'm gonna cut off his head

I been down since I begin to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all
Hard luck and trouble is my only friend
I been on my own ever since I was ten
Born under a bad sign
I been down since I begin to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all
I can't read haven't learned how to write
My whole life has been one big fight
Born under a bad sign
I been down since I begin to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all
I ain't lyin'
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no kinda luck
If it wasn't for real bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all
Wine and women is all I crave
A big legged woman is
gonna carry me to my grave
Born under a bad sign
I been down since I begin to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all
Yeah my bad luck boy
Been havin' bad luck all of my days yesMany a tear has to fall
But its all in the game
All in the wonderful game
That we know as love
You have words with him
And your futures looking dim
But these things your heart can rise above
Once in a while he wont call
But its all in the game
Soon hell be there at your side
With a sweet bouquet
And hell kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away
Many a tear has to fall
But its all in the game
All in the wonderful game
That we know as love
You have words with him
And your futures looking dim
But these things your heart can rise above
Once in a while he wont call
But its all in the game
Soon hell be there at your side
With a sweet bouquet
And hell kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly awayA little bit of soap will wash away your lipstick on my face
But a little bit of soap will never never never ever erase
The pain in my heart and my eyes as I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears
Mmm a little bit of soap will wash away your powder from my chin
A little bit of soap will never never never ever begin
To take away the hurt that I feel as I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears mmm mmm mmm
Have you heard when love begins to die it leaves someone to cry night and Day
Like a bird you left your robin's nest anda just like all the rest you flew away
Mmm a little bit of soap will take away your perfume eventually
But a little bit of soap will never wash away the memory
Of your name in the night that I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears
I'll never lose the memory of your name in the night that I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears
Mmm a little bit of soapa will never wash away my tears
Mmm it's gonna never never never uhhuh wash away my tearsWhether I'm right whether I'm wrong
Whether I find a place in this world or never belong
I've gotta be me I've gotta be me
What else can I be but what I am
I want to live not merely survive
And I won't give up this dream of life
That keeps me alive
I've gotta be me I've gotta be me
The dream that I see makes me what I am
That faraway prize a world of success
Is waiting for me if I heed the call
I won't settle down or settle for less
As long as there's half a chance that I can have it all
I'll go it alone that's how it must be
I can't be right for somebody else if I'm not right for me
I've gotta be me I've gotta be me
Daring to try to do it or die I've gotta be meSoon the pines will be falling everywhere
Village children always fighting for fair share
And the sixonine goes roarin' down the creek
As Parson Lee prepares his service for next week
I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well she's really lookin' fine for eightyfour
And she asked me if some time I'd fix the barn
Poor old girl she needs a man down on the farm
And it's good old country comforts in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old fashioned feeling in my bones
Country comforts and the road that's going home
Down at the mill they've got a new machine
Foreman says it cuts manpower by fifteen
Oh but that ain't natural old man Grayson says
'Cause he's a horsedrawn man until his dying daysAutumn days lying on a bed of leaves
Watching clouds up through the trees
You said our love was more than time
But it's colder now
The trees are bare and the nights are long
Can't get warm since you've been gone
I can't stop singing sad songs
Where do I go from here
Tell me where do I go from here
You said you'd take me through the years
So where do I go from here
Lover's plans like fallen leaves on windy days
Flutter past and they fly away
I thought I knew you oh so well
And I need you now
I need to feel you in the night
I need your smile so warm and bright
I wish my mind could let you go
Where do I go from here
Tell me where do I go from here
You said you'd take me through the years
So where do I go from hereWillie and Laura Mae Jones were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us in a shack just like our shack
The people worked the land together and we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land you don't have the time to think about another man's coulour
The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time
We'd sit out on the front porch in the evenin' when the sun went down
Willie would play and the kids would sing and everybody would mess around
And Daddy bring on his guitar we'd play all through the night
And every now and then ol' Willie would grin and say
'Hey you play alright' 
I remember the best times of all when Saturday came around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
'Do y'all need anything from town'
He'd say 'No but why don't cha all stop on your way back through
And I'll get Laura Mae to cook us some barbecue '
The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine 
But that was another place and another time
The years rolled past our land and took back what they'd given
We all knew we'd have to move if we were gonna make a livin'
So we all moved on and went about our separate ways
Sure it was hard to say goodbye to Willie and Laura Mae  oh yeah
The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine 
But that was another place and another time
The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine 
But that was another place and another timeAnd now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more much more than this
I did it my way
Yes there were times I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out I faced it all
And I stood tall and did it my way
I've loved I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way
Oh no oh no not me
I did it my way
For what is a man what has he got
If not himself then he has not
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
Yes it was my wayOn a quiet street
In the city
A littleold man walked along
Shufflin' thru the autumn afternoon
And the autumn leaves reminded him
Another summer's come and gone
He had a lonely night ahead
Waitin' for June
Then among the leaves
Near the orphan's home
A piece of paper caught his eye
And he stooped to pick it up with trembling hands
As he read the childish writing
The old man began to cry
'Cause the words burned inside of him
Like a brand
Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you
The old man's eyes searched the orphan's home
And came to rest upon a child
With her nose pressed up against the window pane
And the old man knew he'd found a friend at last
So he waved at her and smiled
And they both knew they'd spend the winter laughing at the rain
And they did spend the winter laughing at the rain
Talkin' thru the trees and exchanging little gifts
They'd made for each other
The old man would carve toys for the little girl
And she would draw picture for him of beautiful ladies
Surrounded by green trees and sunshine
And they laughed a lot
But then on the first day of June
The little girl ran to the fence to show
The old man a picture she had drawn
But he wasn't there
And somehow the little girl knew he wasn't coming back
So she went back to her little room
Took a crayon piece of paper and wrote
Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love youSo close as we dance across the floor
So close to the one that I adore
So close in your arms yet so far from your heart
So close to the lips I long to kiss
So close tell me why do you resist
So close in your arms yet so far from your heart
We're so close to the real sensation
But so far it's only been conversation
Now if you love me let it show
But I I've gotta know I just got to know
Because I'm
Too close to the chance I'd love to take
Too close to the vows I'd love to make
Too close in your arms to be so far from your heart
So closeWhen I go to all the places we used to go
When I see all the people we used to know
They ask me why I look so sad I have to say
I got what I wanted but I lost what I had
Without your love I'm such a lonely man that's what I am
And there's no one but myself to take the blame
Because I once had your love and I treated you so bad
I got what I wanted but I lost what I had
Since you've gone the bright lights are dim
The people don't seem the same
They're so used to seeing us together
Oh but my how things have changed
I went searching not knowing what I'd find
I looked for something and I had it all the time
Now to think I've treated you so bad makes me sad
I got what I wanted but I lost I had
I got what I wanted but I lost what I hadThe same one you said you needed
The same one who needed you
That same one is lonely
Please mend the heart you've broken in two
The same one you played a game with
The same one who gave his all
That same one is begging
Completely at your beck and call
Although you're ficklehearted
But darling I will forgive
'Cause I knew the day we parted
Without you I could not live
The same one you played a game with
The same one who gave his all
That same one is waiting
Completely at your beck and callI know I'm losing you I feel it all the time
And I know if I lose you then I'll lose my mind
So lie to me lie to me make me believe everything you say
Just lie lie lie lie I'd rather have it that way
Nobody told me you were cheating
Aw it's just a feeling I had
So if I'm right you got to lie to me
Then I won't feel so bad
Because the truth would only hurt me
And that price is too big to pay
So lie to me lie to me I'd rather have it that way
Now you may think I'm foolish for saying what I said
But the truth could mean I'd lose you
So tell me a little lie insteadLet me tell you a story about a boll weevil
Now some of you may not know
But a boll weevil is an insect
And he's found mostly where cotton grows
Now where he comes from nobody really knows
But this is the way story goes
The farmer said to the boll weevil
I see you're on the square
Boll weevil said to the farmer
Say yep my whole darn family's here
We gotta have a home gotta have a home
The farmer said to the boll weevil
Say why do you pick my farm
The weevil just laughed at the farmer and said
We ain't gonna do ya much harm
We're looking for home
And the boll weevil spotted a lightning bug
He said Hey I'd like to make a trade with you
'Cos you see if I was a lightning bug
I'd search the whole night through
Searching for home I'd have me plenty of homes
And the boll weevil called the farmer and he said
You better sell your old machines
'Cause when I'm through with your cotton
You can't even buy gasoline
I gonna stake me a home gotta have a home
And the boll weevil said to the farmer said
Farmer I'd like to wish you well
Farmer said to the boll weevil
Yeah I wish that you were in
Lookin' for home lookin' for a home
Ah you have a home all right
You'd have a home real hot homeDear Mr Editor wontcha please
Print my story in your magazine
Warn all the lovers how a cheating heart
Can only end up in misery
I was a lyin' cheating fool
Treated her so cruel
Broke her heart and made her cry
Broke every rule and that's my
 she can read the story
 that's my true confession
 and I'm sorry

I would call her up and apologize
If I was half the man I should be
But I'm afraid it's too late for that
Cause I know she wouldn't listen to me
I was a lyin' cheating fool
Treated her so cruel
Broke her heart and made her cry
Broke every rule and that's my
True confession she can read the story
 athat's my true confession
 let her know that I'm

I know her love was true
But I made her cry time after time
Until one day she couldn't take it no more
She said goodbye to me and walked straight out the door so

And I'll be true oh so true
And I'll love her till the day I die
And that's my

And I'm sorryYour lips on mine are soft as dew
Your kiss is so divine
Your eyes are like the skies of blue
And stars that brightly shine
Your voice is sweet like violins
And warm like summer days
I love you I love you I love you
In oh oh so many many ways
Your touch is like a breath of spring
You give life to my soul
To me sweetheart you're everything
I ever hoped to hold
A smile from you lights up my heart
And brightens all my days
And I just love you I love you I love you
In oh oh so many many waysThink twice before you answer
Think twice before you say Yes
I'm asking you if you love me true
Because you're my happiness
Take your time think it over
Think twice then let me know
If you don't feel that your love is real
Tell me although you'll hurt me so
Funny how a word can mean everything
That's why I want you to talk to me
To hear you say my name I'd give anything
Only you can decide what my future will be
Think twice before you answer
Think twice whatever you do
A love as strong as mine can stand the test of time
Think twice of the one who loves youWhat time is it baby is it that time again
When snow will be falling friends will be calling
You know it's time when there'll be carolers singing Silent Night
I love when they sing the feeling it brings
It's warm as a fire is bright
Soon there'll be toys for good girls and boys
And reindeer are heading our way
Yes and Santa will come down the chimney above
There's one thing I wanted to say
I wish every day could be like Christmas
And if I could have one wish come true
I wish every day could be full of peace and harmony
I wish every day could be like Christmas I do
I saw a child sit with old Mr Clause
Looked him in the eye and he asked old Santa what peace on earth was
Now the old man grew cautious on how he would say
That it's the greatest gift what you could give every day
I wish every day could be like Christmas
And if I could have one wish come true
I wish every day could be full of peace and harmony
I wish every day could be like Christmas I do
Now the mistletoe and the house aglow
All the world seems at ease tonight
And all that I ask when these precious moments pass
Is why can't every day be so bright
I wish every day could be like Christmas
And if I could have one wish come true
I wish every day could be full of peace and harmony
I wish every day could be like Christmas I do
Honest I do yes I do now
Very merry ChristmasI want to thank you pretty baby for giving your love to me
I want to thank you pretty baby for giving your love to me

in your tender years
And you'll know I love you
with love that's sincere
I'll wait till you're thru living
in your tender years
last night at 4 am you said goodbye
your eyes betrayed you I could feel you cry
and all the while I could hear my voice
struggling to pretend that it was my choice
and I'd give up forever to change this routine
and sooner or later we glimpse the unseen
too late I found your note
too late I saw the signs
and felt a moment of truth and no
I never tried and you pulled away
and I let you fade away into the day
every word that you spoke to me
it danced on air it had a life of its own
and now you've flown away
but I'll find a way to make you mine one more time
every part of me aches for your skin
I can still feel the warmth that you hold within
the sweetest soul I have ever met
promise me darling that you won't forget
and I fall down into your deep brown eyes
I'll wing my way back to you through clear blue skies
too late I found your note
too late I saw the signs
and felt a moment of truth and no
I never tried and you pulled away
and I let you fade away into the day
every word that you spoke to me
it danced on air it had a life of its own
and now you've flown away
but I'll find a way to make you mine one more time
and now the silence intoxicates me
and I see the sun in your look
the fairy tale is just beginning
and I can't close the book
I'll sip no more of bitterness I'm on my way
the distance cannot keep us apart come what may
too late I found your note
too late I saw the signs
and felt a moment of truth and no
I never tried and you pulled away
but I won't let you fade away into the day
every word that you spoke to me
it danced on air it had a life of its own
and now you've flown away
but I'll find a way to make you mine one more timeShe was a pretty little filly not a run of the mill
the kind of smokin' little woman makes time stand still
with the bad attitude and the curves to match a
rockin' honey with the money and a hell of a catch
She stared right into my eyes and I thought her mistaken
she was smokin' and a'cracklin like a strip of bacon
she grabbed onto my lapels and in a voice so sweet
said I think it's time for you and I to make ends meet
I know you're thinking this is too good to be true
she was wearin' a wire
she done broke mah heart
she was on patrol and I was breaking my parole
she was wearin' a wire
that undercover tart
turns out she never had to say what the hell she was doing in town that day
I was caught between the sheets by a devil in a tube top devil in a tube top
hey hey mister I got something real special for you
she said hey hey mister I'll throw your world askew
hey hey mister come throw a girl a bone
I said hold on baby I never seen a gstring with a microphone
She had a big smile on her face as she slammed the door
that boom echoed up and down the empty cell floor
I stared right back at her through the cold steel bars
said babe' it ain't too late for us to reach them stars
With a giggle and a wink she backed up from me
and with a toss of her hips she produced the key
and in a move I can only call cliche
she bent over and let it fall into her lingerie
come get it boy or am I too much girl for you
she was wearin' a wire
she done broke mah heart
I could only stand and let my libido accrue
she was wearin' a wire
that undercover tart
turns out she never had to say what the hell she was doing in town that day
I was caught between the sheets by a devil in a tube top devil in a tube top
hey hey mister I got something real special for you
she said hey hey mister I'll throw your world askew
hey hey mister come throw a girl a bone
I said hold on baby I never seen a gstring with a microphone
My heart began to race while I watched her strip
she said I like your style come on and give me a tip
I looked right into her eyes and said I ain't no snitch
but then the villain in my pants he began to twitch
I was a beaten man couldn't take no more
I begged her to come and even the score
she glanced down at her belt said I got some toys
now be a good boy and not too much noise
I did the deed and I hit the hay

I never seen a gstring with a microphoneby the sight by the sound
by the fervour underground
I could tell she'd struck again
her disease was so profound
by the smoke by the smog
by the covering of fog
I could see her pretty face
foaming like a rabid dog
the house burned into ash
vaporized in a flash
my mouth could only form
the words that said it all
OMG WTF BBQ 911
she's gone and had her way with matches again
the fire's in her eyes and her beauty her disguise
as she danced out of the flames that would fill the open skies
singing whoaaaaaaaa and then she'd slip away
and fall into my arms
OMG WTF BBQ 911
I try to stop her but she's just too hot to handle
my pretty baby my little lady
noone needs to know your dark identity
everytime you show up smelling like gasoline
I just pretend it's a new kind of sunscreen
you're my fantasy you're my potpourri
you add spice to the vanilla in my life
you pyromaniac walking heart attack
how did I ever find a girl as sweet as you
OMG WTF BBQ 911
she's gone and had her way with matches again
the fire's in her eyes and her beauty her disguise
as she danced out of the flames that would fill the open skies
singing whoaaaaaaaa and then she'd slip away
and fall into my arms
OMG WTF BBQ 911
I try to stop her but she's just too hot to handle
hypnotizing flames dance higher
try to escape the alibi
the authorities are closing in now
my lovely arsonist must say goodbye
you're my firework my guilty pleasure
you'll carry torches for me forever
the passions smoldering noone's following
the blaze in my heart immolates all danger
burnoh how it burns it burns it burns oh how it burns
baby so sweet like apple pie with a filling akin to spanish fly
she's addictive comely and makes it all a dream that leads to angel's fall
have mercy little devil have mercy mercy
SHE'S SMOKING
OMG WTF BBQ 911
she's gone and had her way with matches again
the fire's in her eyes and her beauty her disguise
as she danced out of the flames that would fill the open skies

I try to stop her but she's just too damn hotyou think you're so damn cute the way you bat your eyes
you think you're freakin' clever the way you spy on all the guys
you think you know it all by peeking in my phone
you think you're gonna find something that's for my eyes alone
what are you looking for when you're snooping around
the problem is you know your sources aren't reliable
playing detective you're a pedigree bloodhound
but there's another word for that kind of animal
you're just a little faker
you shake your money maker
it seems I've got myself a
Sherlock Honey
stop fighting moriarty
give up the morphine party
you can't deduce a thing
here comes the honey shot
you think you you're so damn sneaky to steal all my passwords
you think you understand that conversation you overheard
you think you hid so well those bugs in my room
you think you're foolin' me but that's what I let you assume
what do I have to do to set your mind at ease
I always comfort you with my rod and staff
you smoke your pipe and say it's elementary
I won't play Watson to give you the last laugh
you're just a little faker
you shake your money maker
it seems I've got myself a
Sherlock Honey

Oh private eye

you say you love me damnit
you're from another planet
you can't deduce a thing
and that's the honey shotI'd just lost my job and thought to myself
Well what could I have done with all that pile of wealth
Then my buddy he calls with an implulsive notion
Says he's heading down south to the Pacific Ocean
I said Hey now  I don't speak a word of the tongue down there
He said Hey now  I promise you'll love the sweet tropical aira
I called up a cab and headed to the airport and wondered what I had in store
My adventure had begun with some gringo fun fo'shore Fo' shore
On our first day out and there she was
A little vision of pink and a scent of flowers
I said Hi how are you and soon our lips met
Then we danced the night away in a pool of sweat
I said Hey now  You could be the most beautiful girl I've known
She said Hey now  I think I'm falling in love with your cheap cologne
The day turned to the night and the night turned to day
and we talked and we laughed all our doubt away
And when we said goodbye I was on cloud nine
and I knew I'd never be alone cuz it goes
I never knew in Acapulco
a kiss could change my whole life story
What was supposed to last a weekend
ended with me as a brand new daddy
I was suddenly woken from the night before
by a furious father at my front door
Clutched in his right hand was a civil war musket
The look on his face said I couldn't be trusted
I said Hey now  We never went past second base
He said Hey now  As a man you are a complete disgrace
Last night you got my daughter three months pregnant you disrespected me my son
Despite his lack of logic his weapon dictated that we marry that day under the Mexican sun and so
I never knew in Acapulco
a kiss could change my whole life story
What was supposed to last a weekend
ended with me as a brand new daddy
whooooaaaaaaaaa
Now I'm a proud father of some
never really sure where my kids come from
My wife is loyal my life is bliss
although she gets pregnant every time we kiss cuz
I never knew in Acapulco
a kiss could change my whole life story
What was supposed to last a weekend
ended with me as a brand new daddy

Now I'm a proud father of some
never really sure where my kids come from
My wife is loyal my life is bliss
although she gets pregnant every time we kissevery time I take your hand
I get the feeling something's bland in your life
and that you need to find a ticket out
what could be the missing link
the ingredient that you might think
could spice it up oh now I wonder wonder wonder wonder
we all hide it that little voice that cries inside
we all decry it then cover our eyes and run and hide
if it's in your nature to enjoy the less than typical than I can help you with that
you can be the bad girl the saucy french maid or the sweet little innocent brat
wayo wayo clap your hands now you're perverted like me
wayo wayo now embrace your newfound freedom
wayo wayo can't you see that it's as clear as can be
wayo wayo you've corrupted your own eden
and now you've found a subtle joy
in discovering your new found toy
and reaching out  to all those naughty thoughts you covered up
you dye your hair you pierce your tongue
tattooes are daring anyone to question
what they assume must be outside the norm
your sporting latex that clings so tightly to your skin
your new corset has molded you into a sin
you're a smooth talking fast walking rule smashing jezebel who doesn't give a damn anymore
you have my total unmitigated outandout attention the kind of girl I adore
wayo wayo clap your hands now you're perverted like me
wayo wayo now embrace your newfound freedom
wayo wayo can't you see that it's as clear as can be
wayo wayo you've corrupted your own eden
I just want your arms around me
to hold you close I can't resist
but first you'll have to find the key
these handcuffs tend to chaff my wrists
wayo wayo clap your hands now you're perverted like me
wayo wayo now embrace your newfound freedom
wayo wayo can't you see that it's as clear as can be
wayo wayo you've corrupted your own edenEver since we were old enough to read
My buddy Jenny and I have been thick as thieves
we snuck out of math class pulled each other's hair
she pushed me down in the mud and I taught her to swear
then one day she calls and says she has a surprise
I show up at her house and can't believe my eyes
it's seems my old pal had saved a special fund
with the goal of making parts of her a bit more rotund
her mo  dest bosom I had not noted before
had growninto a sight that I could not ignore
Oh No Jenny got busted
she's stretching sweaters and breaking hearts
Oh Yeah Jenny augmented
I can't believe I'm that so damn superficial
Oh No Jenny added on
her upstairs floor has a brand new balcony
Oh Yeah Jenny got busted
and now my downstairs needs her woman's touch
despite her new look which she had failed to inherit
dear Jenny and me wuz still like peas and carrots
but deep inside I knew that it couldn't last
with the vast new contents that her bra had amassed
I didn't want to risk a friendly slap
from getting caught staring at that booby trap
and worst thing of all with all this nonstop verbiage
there ain't no damn word that even rhymes with cleavage
she realized she had a new kind of appeal
my metaphysics say if I can touch them then they're real
Oh No Jenny got busted
she's stretching sweaters and breaking hearts
Oh Yeah Jenny augmented
I can't believe I'm that so damn superficial
Oh No Jenny added on
her upstairs floor has a brand new balcony
Oh Yeah Jenny got busted
and now my downstairs needs her woman's touch
though it's sad to say it to her dismay it it wasn't always a walk in the park
all of her guy friends they wanted more than she was willing
one by one they dropped off they couldn't take it and she couldn't fake it and she didn't know
where this was going she felt alone
Oh No Jenny got busted
she's stretching sweaters and breaking hearts
Oh Yeah Jenny augmented
I can't believe I'm that so damn superficial
Oh No Jenny added on
her upstairs floor has a brand new balcony
Oh Yeah Jenny got busted
and now my downstairs needs her woman's touch
Oh No Jenny got busted
she's making mountains out of molehills
Oh Yeah Jenny operated
I can't keep my eyes above neck level
Oh No Jenny added on
her upstairs floor has a brand new balcony
Oh Yeah Jenny got busted
and now my downstairs needs her woman's touchHey shawty what's yo numbah
I got money in the bank
I'm rollin in my pimped out ride
Back up dat ass I wanna spank
I'm checkin' out you checkin' me
I'm gonna get you all alone
And when you naked on the 'flo
We'll down a bottle of patron
Oh goddddddddddd
What the hell where did good taste go
Another talentless hack on the radio
He never learned to sing
He found his voice in a cereal box
There once was a time when it took more edge
Than a weekend course in studio knowledge
When lyrics meant something
And singers didn't sound like androids
Let me off this stroller coaster
I'm far too bored with the repeated repetition
Can't they find another toy
Cuz this one's played out there's no competition
But in the meantime I'll throw myself on the wagon
I can't sing so I'm singing like a douchebag
Singing like a douchebag whoaaaaaaa
I've got no skill so I'm singing like a douchebag
Singing like a douchebag whoaaaaaaa
I think I'm a robot I think I'm R2D2
Singing like a douchebag whoaaaaaaa
Do you believe in singing like a douchebag
Douchebag singing like a douchebag
Years ago when I was just a lad
I'd never heard a song with this pathetic fad
They can't hold a note or carry a tune
In their bravado soaked hands
Just like plastic surgery it's reached a peak
Where too much tuning has created a freak
Where music is synthetic
And singers just sound like assholes
It's not too late to buck the trend
And lose the gimmick that you can't defend
Maybe with some vocal coaching
You won't have to pretend
I can't sing so I'm singing like a douchebag
Singing like a douchebag whoaaaaaaa
I've got no skill so I'm singing like a douchebag
Singing like a douchebag whoaaaaaaa
I think I'm a robot I think I'm R2D2
Singing like a douchebag whoaaaaaaa
Do you believe in singing like a douchebag
Douchebag singing like a douchebag
I want to sing better
But this way I'm artistic and creative
What once was an annoyance
Has grown into something we can't forgive
I want to sing better
But this way I'm artistic and creative
What once was an annoyance
I just can't can't let live but
I can't sing so I'm singing like a douchebag
Singing like a douchebag whoaaaaaaa
I've got no skill so I'm singing like a douchebag
Singing like a douchebag whoaaaaaaa
I think I'm a robot I think I'm R2D2
Singing like a douchebag whoaaaaaaa
Do you believe in singing like a douchebag
Douchebag singing like a douchebagSo now it's over you chose another
this despite all of my best moves undercover
carnal fun was the basis of the affair
I was fooled into thinking that you did care
Ey Oh It's ok you left my life in disarray
Ey Oh I'll get by I'm not that other guy
who's probably been wondering where is it that you go
when you show up at 3 am with no explanation
another way another day another lifetime
well I might have been yours and well you might have been mine
but I had you I had you I had you my dear
not in your head but in your bed nibbling your ear
I had you I had you I had you in every way
though you were never mine you were my personal buffet
it's not the best day it's not the worst day
just a day that I knew would always come day
Such a shame that I'll never meet your mother
a part of me will miss you more than another
Ey Oh It was fun you'll always be my number one
Ey Oh Sad but true I guess I'm number two
another way another day another lifetime
well I might have been yours and well you might have been mine
and still I had you I had you I had you my dear
not in your head but in your bed nibbling your ear
I had you I had you I had you in every way
though you were never mine you were my personal buffet
and everytime you used to smile at me well it would set me free and I could only be for you

we clearly never shared the same point of view

what's this what can this be 5 seats back on a flight to miami
there you are with a look of shock you just can't wait for this boat to dock
call it coincidence or call it fate I finally see you with your true soul mate
now I see the reason you wouldn't commit you couldn't love me cuz you married a hobbit
still I had you I had you I had you my dear
not in your head but in your bed sucking on your ear
I had you I had you I had you in every way
though you were never mine you were my personal buffet
I had you I had you I had you even more
I fell in love with you you just wanted to screw and walk out the door
I had you I had you something like 50 times
out in the sun wirth your pants undone I enjoyed the crimesIt was a dark and stormy night and the bar was packed
I took a long hard pull on Jimmy John and Jack
My buddies were a mess we all looked like shit
and I was scanning round the place for any targets to hit
I said what next can I get some rough sex
Can I find a victim for my next conquest
and just when I lamented
that the night was circumvented
in walked three fine young contented
foxy fine females
We rolled on up and I tipped my hat
thinking time to show these ladies where the cool kids at
We didn't mean no harm and I was dripping with charm
but their cool reaction said we'd bought the farm
Their eyes cold frost told us all to get lost
get the hell away begone at any cost
but just when doom was looming
conversation was resuming
and then they began consuming
some tequila shots
Everybody knows somebody
who can't control their alcohol
And when they've lost those inhibitions
accidental pimps can have it all
As we watched from afar we saw 'em gulping it down
There was so much liquid flowing that I thought they would drown
We knew at that point that they were deep in a binge
and we had an opportunity to take our revenge
so we found a couple guys looking desperate as hell
said for a hundred bucks that they could have some tail
then I pointed to the threesome
said it was my little harem
all they had to do was grab'em
and the night was theirs
Everybody knows somebody
who can't control their alcohol
And when they've lost those inhibitions
accidental pimps can have it all
What I did was wrong but those chicks were gone
Within moments it was on like donkey kong
They never figured out what we'd gone and done
and selling their ass paid for our night of fun
I say what now got a new cash cow
I'm the new king milk years out of this sow
Just when you've made the grade
in this game you always played
threw yourself on the grenade
and you're finally getting laid
who d'ya think is getting paid
Everybody knows somebody
who can't control their alcohol
And when they've lost those inhibitions
accidental pimps can have it all
Everybody needs some money

at least to buy some alcohol

And when your wallet's nearly empty

accidental pimps can have a ball
There was a time when we would laugh
and throw around great piles of cash
but that's gone it looks like that's gone whoa ohhh
There was a time when caviar
was served inside our luxury car
but that's gone I guess that's also gone whoa ohhh
It seems just days ago
Our lives were lived inside a bubble
Despite the gains in our bank occount
Our love remained subprime
Tucked away in our economy
lay a ticking bomb of fiscal folly
and soon we'd reap the dividends
of being funemployed
I didn't get laid and I didn't get off
but they said to take my stuff and walk
I've got no job and I've got no pay
but I'm free to hold you every day
whoaaaa oh oh love in the time of recession
whoaaaa oh oh let's take a 7 month staycation
whoaaaa oh oh our savings have all disappeared
whoaaaa oh oh now kiss me through my recession beard
So now we have to ask ourselves
Do we miss the gold that filled our shelves
Cuz it's gone it looks like it's gone whoa ohhh
Was it a crutch we were Lehman on
or was it just another con
but it's gone I guess it's also gone whoa ohh
You look so very cute
underneath your golden parachute
You debonnaire recessionista
I'll never leave your side
You stimulate my package growth
There's nothing better for us both
We've made it past the tipping point
and made the right downturn
I didn't get laid and I didn't get off
but they said to take my stuff and walk
I've got no job and I've got no pay
but I'm free to hold you every day
whoaaaa oh oh love in the time of recession
whoaaaa oh oh let's take a 7 month staycation
whoaaaa oh oh our savings have all disappeared
whoaaaa oh oh now kiss me through my recession beard
I love the way you act like a sexual creditor
You're my own personal cash bailout
With you while making love there's no recessionary period
Like a bear market you're always going down
SOLO
Hey ho let's go
Grab your partner now doseedo
We're too big too fall we're all set to brawl
We've too much cash to blow
Hey ho let's go
The economy is too quick to slow
We've seen it all we're standing tall
Just look out way below
I didn't get laid and I didn't get off
but they said to take my stuff and walk
I've got no job and I've got no pay
but I'm free to hold you every day
whoaaaa oh oh love in the time of recession
whoaaaa oh oh let's take a 7 month staycation
whoaaaa oh oh our savings have all disappeared

whoaaaa oh oh we'll start a little ponzi scheme
whoaaaa oh oh I know not working's kinda weird
whoaaaa oh oh now kiss me through my recession beardThere's a girl I think comes straight from heaven I long to know
Now all who has met her said she's better than expressions of love and soul
Now I thank faith for expressing to me your love is more than I expected to see
Ooh baby baby feel so good ooh baby baby feel so good
Now I know if I were to travel across the waters come here to there
Nothing on earth would be hardly worth my love and there's so many ways that care
Now I thank faith for expressing to me your love is more than I expected to see
Ooh baby baby feel so good ooh baby baby feel so good

Immune to pain and human screams
You saw destruction from the sky
but never once viewed those who died
The haunting sight of blood soaked sand
That never burdened TV Land
You watched our nation swallow shit
and made the war a primetime hit
The war was just a passing fad
Just yellow ribbons
nothing bad
No need to watch the senseless slaughter
of loving mothers sons and daughters
The haunting sight of blood soaked sand
will never burden TV land
You watched our nation swallow shit
and made the war a primetime hitFirst a boy and a girl meet each other
Then they sit down to talk for a while
In your heart you'll want her for a lover
While each step draws you closer to the aisle
You may start with a simple conversation
My darling please put me on trial
She says yes and your heart starts beating
While each step draws you closer to the aisle
You ask her if she loves you she answers I do
Your heart starts glowing inside
And then you will know she is just for you
While each step draws you closer to the aisle
Then you put a ring on her finger
And the tears start flowing awhile
Then you'll know she's yours forever
While each step draws you closer to the aisleIn the still of the night
I held you
Held you tight
'Cause I love
Love you so
Promise I'll never
Let you go
In the still of the night
I remember
That night in May
The stars were bright above
I'll hope and I'll pray
To keep
Your precious love
Well before the light
Hold me again

In the still of the night
So before the light
Hold me again
With all of your might

Lovin what youre doin' to meOh no Our legs are touching
Touching on the bus
Well I'm not moving
It doesn't bother me
My leg is stiff and shaking
But it doesn't bother me
Thank you For pretending an itch
Now I can be in my own space
And ignore everyone else
Oh no Our legs are touching
Touching on the bust's all been said
But only in my head
I needed something
But nothing now instead
Talking on and on about how
Everything will be
I see it everyday
There's no reason to stay
It's over now
But nothing goes away
Back to my home
Your cover's blown
I wanted you to know
I wanted you to know
And if the chance comes through
I don't know what I'd do
The choice was made cut like a blade
But in its wake I grew
Thousands of miles apart
I wouldn't know where to start
A broken mirror but somehow clearer
I feel it in my heartThey're coming true
All of those things that I thought
Would never happen to me
I'm starting new
Pushing away all my doubts
And finally breaking free
I'm sick of this place
I'm sick of the taste
I'm sick of everyone around me
For three long months
I rotted away in this room
With no sense of comfort at all
What happened to you
What happened to everything I put my heart into
And as it turns out
I meant everything I said
And you meant none of it
I walk for miles into the unknown
Just trying to understand
I've opened my eyes
Seems like the first time
I acted on something
Took control of my life
I won't just be a secret you keep
I'll be out singing while you're asleep
All the blood that you drew
Made it that much
Easier to walk away from you
And I know what I must do
Learn from the past and live through my own truth
They're coming true
All of those things that I hoped
Would always happen to me
I'm starting new
Breathing life into all of the things
That meant the world to meFall into dark water
These gray skies look farther
The fog is too dense to see through the way
Reach out and say goodbye
Our future's begun
The devil's tempting me
With memories of what I loved
Lies and deceit from up above
Year after year I watch you fade away
You fade away
A different escape
False memories
They betray
Free from the gallows
I'm tripping on shadows
Ghosts of the past sink into my dreamsRepeating everything in my head
Stuck on the words that I knew you said
I think you thought what you didnt know
When will we come for those things you broke
But it hurts
Every single day
But youre not listening
Nothing will change
Stuck in this rut and Im coming up short
And I try to reach out but Im playing the part
Well I dont know what you were thinking
But I think
You thought wrong
Gone are the days when I used to choke
My faith in you has gone up in smoke
Im not enough for you now and I never will
Ive finally escaped from this living hell
Your hellAnd you know that we're out of control And you know that we can't take anymore so let's go Yo girl we gotta get outta here Hey baby do you remember the days when we used to hold hands And everything seemed okay running through the streets at night alright oh yeah Hey baby do you remember the times when everything seemed fine Running round town with our fists in the air smashing out windows 'cause we don't care And you know that we're out of control And you know that we can't take anymore so let's go Yo girl we gotta get outta here Hey baby come on Yo girl we're gonna lose control Hey baby come on let's go Hey baby do you remember when they used to say god damn Pointing their fingers as we walked by pointing their fingers but that's alright Hey baby do you remember when

Oh this heart of mine
Carries a heavy load
When I think about
How I've hurt you so 
After you've been
Been so good to me
I've been unfaithful darling
I've caused you misery 
A feeling of guilt
Oh it tortures me
And only you my darling
Oh can set me free 
And darling all all I need
Is just to hear you say
You'll forgive me
Forgive me baby
All all I need
To have you touch my hand
Say you'll understand baby
A moment of weakness darling 
Caused me to stray
Your trust in me dear I threw away
When I look look into your eyes
I can see the hurt baby
That you feel inside 
Although I've hurt you baby
You've never once complained
It makes me feel sweet darling
That much more ashamed 
Tear of guilt tears of guilt running down my face
Tears that only you baby
Only you can erase 
And darling all all I need
Is just to hear you say
You'll forgive me
Forgive me baby
All all I need
To have you touch my hand
Say you'll understandThe sun maybe shining sunny and bright
But my world is black like the the darkness of the night
For me the stars up above refuse to shine
Since I lost that precious baby of mine
Since I lost that precious baby of mine
The month of May may bring blossoms to the trees
But all of this beauty I'm much to blind to see
Take away my sight it's no good to me
'Cause loneliness is my destiny
Lonely loneliness is my destiny
And I feel like crying crying
Almost dying dying dying dying
She left me in a world of darkness darkness
When she took her sweet love away from me oh yeah
She took her sweet love away from me
I walk the street at night with no destination
Since she been gone I have no inspiration
When I stop to see just what she's done to me
I see tear stained eyes cloudy skies
I'm lonely man just a half of man that needs his baby
So I feel like crying crying
Feel like dying dying dying dying dying
The girl she left me in a state of confusion and darkness
When she took her sweet love away from me oh yeah
Why did you take your sweet love away from me
Ooh why did you take it baby
In my heart I'm crying sometimes I feel like dying dying dying dying
She left me I a state of confusion and darkness
Girl why why why did you take your love
Oh baby why did you take your love away from me

No satisfaction baby nowhere in sight

Just a half a man
That needs his baby
And I feel like crying
I'm in a world of darkness
I'm all alone baby
Once she took her love
Why you take your love

I fell like crying in the morning
Crying in the evening
Oh baby feel like dying dying dying dying dying dying
You left me in a world of confusion and darkness
Why did you take it baby
Why did you take your love away from me
Why did you take your sweet love away from me

Don't take it don't take it don't take it a way from me
Oh baby don't take it away from me
Good God don't take it away from meI was out riding so I road by where we use to stayThe people we knew and trusted has all since then moved awayIt's not that I don't love youyou know how much I do And it's not that I've found someone to take the place of youIt's just a fear that builds within me everytime you touch my handAnd a dread that shakes my bodythat even I don't understandso I'm leavingThis time I'm playing it smartI'm gonna walk away from love before love breaks my heart
Oh you're clenging to me tighter than you ever have beforeI don't understand itBut I know it's gonna take everything I've got to keep walking out the doorBut those arms you've got around me will let me go somedayAnd I'd rather leave you holding onthan pushing me awayso I'm leaving yes I amThis time I'm playing it smartI'm gonna walk away from love before love breaks my heartLast week my life had meaning it was beautiful and so sweet
But now it's nothing nothing without you baby
My whole world is incomplete
'Cause honey I can't see you no more
That was all that you said baby
But you just might as well placed a gun to my head baby baby

My Whole World Ended the moment you left me Yeah baby
Honey My Whole World Ended the moment you left me
It tumbled down to the ground baby
Did you ever mean those sweet things
Ah that you used to say
 Did you mean it baby
Of a house with a lovely lovely garden
And a little baby some day
Ah Tell me where did I go wrong honey
Whatever changed your mind baby
I've asked myself these questions over a million times baby baby

My Whole World Ended the moment you left me Yeah baby
Honey My Whole World Ended the moment you left me
It tumbled down to the ground baby baby baby
Now my body is numb I feel so senseless to the touch
My life is so wasted without you
I guess I loved you much too much
How can I face tomorrow
When yesterday is all I see
I just don't wanna face tomorrow if you're not sharing it with me
Baby baby

My Whole World Ended the moment you left me Yeah baby
Honey My Whole World Ended the moment you left me
It tumbled down to the ground baby baby babyHmm hmm hmmmmm
I was raised an only child
My folks died when I was four
They were trapped in a fire
Way up on the fourteenth floor
Well my lovin' granny raised me
'Til I reached the age of ten
But the good Lord took her too
And left my dog Jeff my only friend
Oh baby
Seem like the odds are against me
Nothing works out right for me ooh
I've lost everything I've ever loved
Honey honey now I'm losing you baby
I've lost everything I've ever ever loved
Honey honey now I'm losing you
Ooh baby
So all my love I gave to Jeff
Cause he was all I had right then
But the wheels of an automobile
Brought his life to a tragic end
From an orphan home to college
Thought I found true love in you
I felt sure we would marry
But your folks did not approve
Oh baby
Seem like the odds are against me
Nothing works out right for me ooh
I've lost everything I've ever loved
Now I'm losing you oh
I've lost everything I've ever loved baby
Honey honey now I'm losing you
Ooh baby
You accepted their decision
Without any type of defense
They said if we wait a few more years
That would make a little more sense
So we waited three or four
Everyday we kept in touch
But when we came face to face
You didn't love me quite as much
Oh baby
Seem like the odds are against me
Nothing works out right for me
I've lost everything I've ever loved
Baby baby baby now I'm losin' you
I've lost everything I've ever loved
Now I'm losin' you
Now I'm losin' you
I've lost everything I've ever loved

Now I'm losin' you
From day to day you keep me guessing
Whether you're mine ooh baby
Sometimes I think you are
And sometimes you show me no sign ooh baby
You're like the weather
And it blows my mind
You turn your love
On and off off and on

Change your love anytime you want to

On and off off and on

Change your love anytime you want to
Sometimes your love burns like a fire
Ooh too hot to hold ooh baby
And sometimes you freeze up like an iceberg
Oh the chill burns so you know you do honey
You're like a faucet
Running hot and cold
You turn your love
On and off off and on

Change your love anytime you want to

On and off off and on

Change your love anytime you want to

You're like the weather
And it blows my mind
You turn it on baby
On and off off and on

Change your love anytime you want to

On and off off and on

Change your love anytime you want to

You turn your love
On and off off and on

Change your love anytime you want to
You turn your love
On and off off and on

Change your love anytime you want to
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If being right means being without
Id rather be wrong
My old man says it's a shame
It's a downright disgrace
As long as I got you by my side
I don't care what our people say
My friend tell me there's no future in loving a married man
If I can't have you when I want you
I'm a see you when I can
Am I wrong to fall so deeply in love with you
Knowing you have a wife and two little children depending on you too
Am I wrong to hunger for the gentleness of your touch
Oh when I got someone else at home who needs me just as much
Am I wrong for giving my love to a married man
Tell me am I wrong for trying to hold on to the best thing I ever hadI have dreamed a dream there a common man
Ah hoping to rise to the top
I have sworn by my blood as your man my love
That one day I promise
One day your hurting would stop
But I'll never never never never change
I never change one single grain of sand
Oh thanks to you baby
For just loving a common man
I want to thank you this evening
Oh I thought I thought that I failed you so
But that's when you turn around and look me in my eyes
And you let me know
You said and you said it softly
I didn't have to worry about being a common man
You said David you don't have to worry about rising to the top
You said you said you said I didn't have to swear by my blood
But ah baby that one day your heartaches would stop
Then you put your arms around me and you said
You never never never never cared
If I never change one single grain of sand
You said I love you baby
I love you for just being a common man
For my gratitude just keep on growing
Yeah for recognizing me I thank you baby
Yeah for respecting me yeah I want to thank you baby
For every time of need Lord I thank you baby
Oh for my gratitude for respecting me baby
For just being a common man
Ah I want to thank you babe
In a time of need I want to thank you for respecting me
In a time of worry I want to thank you for calming my troubles
Oh I thank you baby

Every since you went away

With my head in my hands

You been away from so long
And I just don't think I can carry on so I start


Each and every night


Trying to drown all my loneliness away
I don't forget a day
Fall down on my knees wishing for your return
And oh how I hurt
'Cause I oh I 
 I miss you baby


Oh Lord 
You can look at my eyes and see
That a great big man like me has been


Crying my heart and soul out to you baby

Sitting in my lonely room
Filled with nothing but gloom and I feel like

Just thought I'd give you a ring and see how you was doing
How's how's everything
A friend of mine told me he saw you the other day
Said you was still looking good
Heh made me feel kind of good you know
Told me told me that you did ask about me

Sometimes it kind of won't let him do what he wanna do

I miss you baby I don't know what to do with my time with myself
Without you baby

You know being they got that lottery I hit it
I'd like to kind of make up for
A lot of things that just seemed not to go right
Don't want you to think I'm trying to buy back your love or your friendship
But now I feel I got a chance to kind of make things up to you a little bit
Heh enough about you and me
How's my little son
Hmm he ever ask about me
Just a little bit
Does he still like to go down by the supermarket
If I could just

Can't really say what you mean or what you want over the phone
I swear I miss you
You done heard it ten times or more but
I swear I done changed
I swear I done changed
 I miss you baby

 oh Lord
Miss you baby yeah baby yeah baby yeah baby


You come alive behind closed doors
You've got a problem you can't ignore
So drive your car light a cigarette
Too young to die too old to regret
You're tired bloodshot eyes
Rip through my insides every time
Be thankful you're alive
Life's far worse when you have to hide
Blood runs from your pulsing soars
Soaks into your open pores
Your hair fell out onto your plate
You can't believe what you just ate
You're vicious terrified
Here and gone at the same time
Your kisses like drivebys
I hate it when you say goodbye
Hammer in the rest of your nails
Load the ships and set the sails
You can't hide inside the cold
Will find it's way into your bones
Woah
I guess this is goodbye
I told myself I wouldn't cry
She screams hold me as we lie
I love it when you say goodnightYou were so young
I was younger than you
I felt broken
You were tiny bits of glue
I was made of
Clay and bits of paper
You were holy
I don't deserve to be with you
Seven matches
Just to light one candle
I can't light it
You keep blowing on the wick
Next year New Year's
I don't know what will happen
It's a long time
For you to still be lying
I don't know how to feel
if you can't tell me this is real
Next year New Year's
I can't see the future
You're clairvoyant
You are breaking our only vows
Will you hold me
Just one last time tonight
We can pretend
It's last year
And we're still alrightAnd I'm drowning alone in this body of water
So I choose to breathe in salt
And my home is no longer where I am living
And I don't think you love me anymore
So I'm reaching for myself inside a bottle
And I'm searching for some friends in a few more
And I see you in black just like a funeral
And I don't think I love you anymore
Save some room if there's light at the end of the tunnel
But step lightly if a train comes through
I'm surrounded by people who love me
But it doesn't include you
No it doesn't include you
Tell me does it include youWe're strange
And worried
As wolves
Caught up in the cattle
There's pain
In our stories
We won't win
Every battle
There's no purpose to life
And if they find us in the light
We will exterminate
Or unite
To the cheats
And the liars
Oh somebody stop me
I wanna burn it down
To the creeps
Who conspire
And try to silence
Our every sound
There's no purpose to life
And if they find us in the light
We will exterminate
Or uniteI can't believe my eyes
This nightmare that's come to life
What sparked the flames
What lit the fires
Can you put 'em out and save my life
Cause I still see them at night
And I won't say I'm alright
Until you hold me
I sleep with opened eyes
Cause I'm not ready to die
I won't say that you're wrong
Cause they've been here for far too long
Im breathing ash
I'm feeling flames
And I've been lying wide awake
Cause I still see them at night
And I won't say I'm alright
Until you hold me
The sheep are spreading lies
But I'm not ready to die
Without a face who can you trust
It's just a reckless hit and run
Cause I still see them at night
And I won't say I'm alright
Until we end this
Violent firefight
Cause I'm not ready to die
No I'm not ready to die
Are you ready to dieI've had enough
She left marks on my spine
Begging me to come inside
She's calling me
Calling me
Calling me all the time
I'm breathing her scent again
This time I am innocent
But I choose in ignorance
The sin the sin the sin
Oh why what do you want from me
What can I say
Cut the head off the snake
It happened again
Crawling on the ocean floor
Beneath a concrete shore
And Jesus wept
A good headstart
On a deadend road
When do they live that's what he want's to know
Oh why what do you want from me
What can I say
Cut the head off the snake
What do you want from me

What do you want from me

What do you want from me
Mourn to cut through
I found your merit in a furrow nearby
Mourn to save you your own beholder
Your own beholder
These walls are built so you can confide
They're painted handsomely so you abide
This glass is coloured black so close your eyes
Numb yourself and you will stay inside
Benign blame yourself
A feeble rodent can only withstand so much
Knives point at me when you are guilty
You are guilty
Pay it forward until you are free
Nothing else is worth it only me
Settle your wounds
Fill your cup with something new
Settle your wounds
Strip yourself from what you knew
I've placed the boards across your windows
I've nailed your hand so you can kiss the floor
A blanket suffocates the things you know
Numb yourself like you did before
Numb yourself like you did before
Numb yourself like you did beforei am coming clean with myself
i'm peeling off a film of a former me and you can tell
i wish you could see me now
i am fluorescent and new
faces in the fixtures are screaming at me once again
fabric fills the holes in their heads
see where it gets me in the end
stay for a minute and listen
bandaging so bittersweet
your spirit glows yet you don't know
suit yourself fittingly
the haze surrounds only us
give the time to come to the mud
weave me into your sin
i am strong and wellfounded but you just don't like to admit it
let your thoughts subside
for every moment living in spite i'm forever in debt
colored vision flooding my eyes
open your being to mine
leave the past behind
softening so bittersweet
i'm holding on yet no one knows
suit yourself fittingly
the dust will swallow us whole
i am coming clean with myself
my darling my darling
now that i've shed my skin you can tell i'm brighter than ever
the flood has washed my bitter design polished in every way
i am coming clean into love
i'll die if you let me
i am coming clean with myself
my darling my darling
now that i've seen the world through your eyes i'm brighter than ever before
bandaging all of me
selfish me so bittersweet
a suspicious love for the sake of us
suit yourself fittingly
my arms are opened up
suit yourself fittingly
the haze surrounds only usyou could be my savior when i'm in need of another one
i could be your bait when you will hide from what you're running from
i was medicated but i ended up where i was
i was beautiful
i was yet to be someone
i know they won't let me in
they don't wear my skin
i know that the pieces fit
i know what you meant
lay me down where you are or where you want to be
there's a quiet breeze and it sings for me
i was giving way for all of the stories i have chose to waste
the bells rang out when you were carried out to keep the pace
i was barricaded
i was choking up from my restraints
i was elegant
i was yet to deviate
i know they won't let me in
they don't wear my skin
i know where the fragments fit
i know what you meant
lay me out on the floor
show off your display
there's a lineament and it fills the walls
lay me out where you are where i need to be
there's a quiet breeze and it sings for me
a ring of chain takes place of me
but where am iSpoonfeed me medicine
Shed myself see me for who I am today
My will is genuine
Mistaken for someone that you embrace
My sober eyes are red
My mind is spinning around an error that I create
Someone to represent someone I forget something I will never bandage
Separate
Soak your head into the sulfur
Stay patient for me
Paint yourself my favorite color
Stay pretty for me
I bled myself out again
You possess something that I never could replace
My time is running thin
You won't be back again
My time is running thin
You won't be back until I say so
Put your head under the water
Stay quiet for me
Make your mouth a little smaller
Stay quiet for meForced to get used to a habit
Stab the face of who you think you are
I'll embed my world in cement
I shook the hand of all my wants
Steal my words
Dive into my sun I was once your mother but I have come undone
I'm conditioned well
A sliver from my lovers something I hold on to
Push your nightmare into my brain
Deface my youth for what you want
I'll throw my bricks into fragile cells
Suppress the ones you love to overcome
Lie to me
Damage meNo one knows where the byway leads to
No one knows what it turns into at the end
Meet me down by the black inlet and I'll show you it
Nails replace the rain piercing the people to their staves
The sun illuminates such a wonderful display
No one seems to know anyone there
No one knows who they love or how they smile
Where do people go when they need some deliverance
The blackness fascinates the privileged and the misbehaved
Still no one has ever walked themselves all of the wayPress your fingers on it igniting what you are
Meet me by the lake I'm ripe with severed faith
You wear wear the only scar
If I'm if I'm a saint then you're heaven My only
If I'm if I'm a waste then you're golden My only
If I'm if I'm a shame then you're bolder than all of me
If I'm a saint then you're heaven My only
Cement for all of our teeth
Cement for all of our teeth
I'll give you myself give you myself any day
Rest your body in it Set fire to your thoughts
Let your arms down Throw your soul out
There is no control
Cement for all of our teeth

Cement for all of our teeth

I'll give you myself give you myself any day
If I'm if I'm flawed then you're perfect My only
If I'm if I'm a liar then you're blameless My only
If I'm if I'm hanging by a thread then you're infinite
If I'm a saint then you're heaven My only
Cement for all of our teeth

Cement for all of our teeth

I'll give you myself give you myself any dayStain your shell in red
Act on my request
Suspend me by the neck make me whole again
A familiar face a bed of thorns
A minor scent from where you were
Let your garden grow
My eyes still twitch for nothing
Loosen your empty hands
My heart still beats for nothing
I'm new but a duplicate
Grown from a nourished bed
I long for a hologram a replica something exact
Stain
Stain
A hand a ring a special place a sea of red from which you came
Let your garden grow
My eyes still twitch for nothing
Loosen your empty hands
My heart still beats for nothing
Take me by the hand be my architect in grey
Sell yourself to me
My eyes still burn to this day
A familiar face a bed of thorns
A minor scent from where you were
Let your garden grow
My eyes still twitch for nothing
Loosen your empty hands
My heart still beats for nothing
Take me by the hand be my architect in grey
Sell yourself to me
My eyes still burn to this dayBe mine shake up my love
Yellow night has had enough
It's been out way too long
I see nothing but yellow love
My love
Be mine
Pull me in two
I will mold myself just for you
The night is vivid for once
Still I see nothing but yellow love
My love
All I feel is celestial desire
A distant joy is dancing all around me
All I see is yellow in the spring air
How beautifully the color worked itself inraise Bellhollow's flag
i feel the night creeping up
tonight is the perfect night
there couldn't be a better one
powder up my skin
make me admirable
spark the match to begin
drain out the methanol
raise Bellhollow's flag
your structure is overlooked
the crowds they fill up your stomach but you don't know what they took
dress me out of ruth
make me lovely
i'll give my match to you
we'll burn here happily
burn
raise Bellhollow's flag
i feel our time is up
be my only grave
send me into the swarm
cleanse myself of filth
make me excellent
let the inferno swell
tonight i am definite
burnGood God I've retributed kept fine against the rage
Hunted destructed then RVed till death
You've tried your last to come through I must
Thrashing the system anew I distress
Find the sins of the deceased
Armed with the sky prepare to die
Armed with rage
Infect the seers leave deceased bled in fear
We can't protect or permit our own fear
Your time has come there is no turning back
Arsens will rip you and wolves will attack
Armed with the sky you can't escape
Fill with pain mankind
The blood runs through me
Tired to rampage flesh I hate my own face
Back trigger join the crowd rampeed their face
Helpless in resort we all find our ways
Before the mistress our blood will attain
Find the sins of the deceased
Armed with the sky prepare to dieI can feel you flowing through me
Holy Spirit come and fill me up
Come and fill me up
Love and mercy fill my senses
I am thirsty for your presence Lord
Come and fill me up
Lord let your mercy wash away
All of my sin
Fill me completely with your love
Once again
I need you
I want you
I love your presence
I need you
I want you
I love your presenceOver all the earth
You reign on high
Every mountain stream
Every sunset sky
But my one request
Lord my only aim
Is that you reign in me again
Lord reign in me
Reign in your power
Over all my dreams
In my darkest hour
You are the Lord of all I am
So won't you reign in me again
Over every thought
Over every word
May my life reflect
The beauty of my Lord
You mean more to me
Than any earthly thing
So won't you reign in me againYou are so far away but I'm so close to you
Your hands cover your eyes but mine reach to hold you
Precious one you know how much I love you
That is why you know how much I miss you
You are scared of the light which can break all your fear
I'm here right here my beloved
Precious one you know how much I love you
That is why you know how much I miss you
I remember when you used to serenade me with our song
It's been so long
I will never forget how you always smiled when you knew I was near
But know I'm still here I'm right here
Precious one you know how much I love you
That is why you know how much I miss you
Oh precious one you know how much I love you
That is why you know how much I miss youI lift my eyes up
To the mountains
Where does my help come from
My help comes from you

So I will wait for you
To come and rescue me

Lord you are more precious than silver
Lord you are more costly than gold
Lord you are more beautiful than diamonds
And nothing I desire compares with youWhile she speaks I search every word
Hoping that she'll give it away
Or my heart would have to agree
All this could it be a mistake
Oh tell me she's the girl
Oh tell me she's the girl
'Cause there's no one like her in this world
Tell me she's the girl
Any day the answer will fall
So I'll keep my hands in the air

Oh tell me she's the girl
'Cause there's no one like her in this world
No one like her in this world
No one like her in this world
Tell me she's the girlAm I but a coward walking down the yellow brick road
Where's my megaphone
Am I but a scarecrow running from the seed that I sowed
Where's my megaphone Where's my megaphone
Truth moves at the speed of sound
Truth moves at the speed of sound
Truth moves at the speed of sound
Am I but a mirrorflattering the fairest of them all
Where's my megaphone
Am I but a princess wearing a disguise to the ball
Where's my megaphone Where's my megaphone
Truth moves at the speed of sound
Truth moves at the speed of sound
Truth moves at the speed of sound
Where's my megaphone Where's my megaphone

Where's my megaphone Where's my megaphoneSeeking hoping trying to be who you want
Fearful thankful able to see a difference oh oh

It's hard to say it but I love you more than all of this

Of how you saved my soul
I could dance a thousand miles
Because of your great love
My heart is bursting Lord
To tell of all you've done
Of how you changed my life
And wiped away the past
I want to shout it out
From every rooftop sing
For now I know that
God is for me not against me
Everybody's dancing now
'Cause we're so happy
Everybody's singing now
'Cause we're so happy
If only we could see your face
See you smiling over us
Unseen angels celebrate
For the joy is in this placeHere's to Him my guardian
There He is He moves faster than light
His body holds tremendous might
His face doth shine ever so bright
His enemies tremble with fright
Jesus is my Superhero
Once He died for me
I'm His trusting sidekick
We will beat the enemy
There he is He labors day and night
Somehow I'm always in His sight
Without a doubt He'll do what's right
With any foe He'll win the fight
Evil's on its way
But my Savior's here to save my dayI crashed in the jungle while tryin' to keep a date
With my little girl who was back in the states
I was stranded in the jungle afraid and alone
Tryin' to figure a way to get a message back home
But how was I to know there was a record jump my plane
Had been picked up and spotted my girl in lovers lane
And meanwhile back in the states

Baby baby let's make romance
You know your old time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle flat as he can be
So come on pretty baby just you and me
Meanwhile back in the jungle
The boys in the jungle had me on the run
When something heavy hit me like an atomic bomb
When I woke up and my head started to clear
I had a strange feeling I was with cooking gear
I smelled something cookin' and I looked to see
That's when I found out they was a cookin' me
Great Cuckoo let me outta her
Meanwhile back in the states

I jumped outta the pot and finally got away
Frantic and worried about what my baby would say
So I jumped in the ocean and started to swim
But my chance of survival was gettin' mighty slim
So I thumbed down a whale who was headin' my way
And I reached the states in bout a half a day
And when I got to lovers lane I was almost dead
When my soul was gone here's what I said
Baby baby your man is no good
Baby baby he should've understood
You can trust me as long as can be
So come back pretty baby where you used to be
Cause I love you cause I love you
Cause I love you cause I love you
Cause I love youThe things you say to feed the lie you started
To break the broken hearted
The things you say to overlook your conscience
To spy another offense
But you're getting lonelier each day
Because every ear is gone
All your words are going nowhere
They only fall into the burning flames
Heard you blow a lot of smoke now
But maybe you're the only one to blame
The things you say to wage a war for nothing
Yeah yeah it's always something
Someday you'll bury the dead with words you should've said
All your words are going nowhere
They only fall into the burning flames
Heard you blow a lot of smoke now
But maybe you're the only one to blame
Oh they are going nowhere
Yeah maybe you're the only one to blame
The things you say the things you say
All your words are going nowhere nowhere
Heard you blow a lot of smoke now
Yeah
All your words are going nowhere nowhere
They only fall into the burning flames
I heard you blow a lot of smoke now
But maybe you're to blame
The things you say the things you say
The things you say the things you say
The things you say the things you say
Oh the things you sayAs the deer panteth for the water
So my soul longeth after thee
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship thee
You alone are my strength my shield
To you alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship thee
You're my friend and you are my brother
Even though you are a king
I love you more than any other
So much more than anything
You alone are my strength my shield
To you alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship thee
I love you more than gold or silver
only you can satisfy
You alone are the real joy giver
and the apple of my eye
You alone are my strength my shield
To you alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship youi'm just a gremmy surfing tandem with the best
on every wave my life is put to the test
i'm just a gremmy getting hassled by the shark
the impact zone is my home till it gets dark
like the tide i'm up then down
but this gremmy sure won't drown
my faith is on the shore
push me in oh Lord
i'm just a gremmy who's addicted to wax
my poor old board is decorated with cracks
i'm just a gremmy with my head in the sand
but now i'm sponsored by a heavenly brand
like the tide i'm high then low
but this gremmy's going proI'm trading my sorrows
I'm trading my shame
I'm laying them down
For the joy of the Lord
I'm trading my sickness
I'm trading my pain
I'm laying them down
For the joy of the Lord
Singing
Yes Lord Yes Lord
Yes Yes Lord
Yes Lord Yes Lord
Yes Yes Lord
Yes Lord Yes Lord
Yes Yes Lord Amen
I'm trading my wealth
I'm trading my pain
I'm laying them down
To the Joy of the Lord
singing
Chorus 
AmenThese long days torment my mind
Am I blind
If I miss the worlds affair
Will I care
Beyond this world
The people dance around their king
Beyond this world
A light brings life to everything
I'll keep my eyes on the sky
Is it nigh
When he comes to take me back
Will I pack
Beyond this world
The people dance around their king
Beyond this world
A light brings life to everything
Father keep my chair at the table
For I'm coming home
I'm just hitch hiking on this long road
But I'm getting close
Beyond this world
The people dance around their king
Beyond this world
A light brings life to everything
Beyond this world
The music plays while angels sing
Beyond this world
A feast is now in the makingThe band played no one moved
They could not find the groove
I knew that wouldn't last
Someone had to act fast
I took the mic for a moment
That's when I sang
This is no talent show
And the floor is ready to go
I know you want to dance
So come on while we have a chance
All I heard was a cough
I started to walk off
Then people wanted more
As they all rushed the floor
I told the band to follow
That's when I sang
This is no talent show
And the floor is ready to go
I know you want to dance
So come on while we have a chance
This is no talent show
And the floor is ready to go
I know you want to dance
So come on while we have a chanceMy heart is craving
A little revelation
Oh so much sweeter
Than my imagination
I'm telling my heart
Catch the sunlight with a spoon
I've only tasted
Your reflection off the moon
My heart is moved by
A higher expectation
Of something sweeter
Than all of creation
I'm telling my heart
Catch the sunlight with a spoon
I've only tasted
Your reflection off the moon
I'm telling my heart
Catch the sunlight with a spoon
I've only tasted
Your reflection off the moon
Every time I blink you'll see it
May I have one glimpse of you
And every time I breathe you'll hear it
May I have one word from you
I'm telling my heart
Catch the sunlight with a spoon
I've only tasted
Your reflection off the moon
I'm telling my heart
Catch the sunlight with a spoon
I've only tasted
Your reflection off the moon
I'm telling my heart
I'm telling my heart
I'm telling my heartYou're a hightide you keep carrying me away
Leave the sand behind and I wont resist
All ths time you've never lost it
And nor will I
If I tried to hide it from you
My heart would tell the truth
I want you I know you want me too
You're a midight balancing yesterday and tomorrow
The world's outside but there's no lonliness
I dont feel lonely here
If I tried to hide it from you
Oh if I tried to keep it from you
Love would break through the foolishness
And it would grant my wish for happiness
If I stood in your armsEvery man has a place in his heart there's a space
And the world can't erase his fantasies
Take a ride in the sky on our ship fantasii
All your dreams will come true right away
And we will live together until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever as one
Every thought is a dream rushing by in a stream
Bringing life to our kingdom of doing
Take a ride in the sky on our ship fantasii
All your dreams will come true miles away
Our voices will ring together until the twelfth of never
We all will live forever as one
Come see victory in the land called fantasy
Loving life a new decree
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty
Our minds will explore together old worlds we conquer forever
We then will expand love together as one
Come to see victory in a land called fantasy
Loving life for you and me to behold to your soul is ecstasy
You will find other kind that has been in search for you
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize it's your life now in review
And as you stay for the play fantasy has in store for you
A glowing light will see you through
It's your day shining day all your dreams come true
As you glide in your stride with the wind as you fly away
Give a smile from your lips and say
I am free yes I'm free now I'm on my wayBusting through the open air now I'm getting somewhere

If you say each day is like a thousand years
Them why do I wait to love you
If you say each day you cry a thousand tears
Then why do I wait to love you
Today it's a day I always face and it wanders by
Do I ever take away the pain
When I take time to whisper words that can make you forget
You know I want to you know I do
But do you know why I'm so confusedYou made a dream then you gave it to me
A dream that I know only God could have dreamed
Tell me what it means
Was it just a dream
You made a dream then you gave it to me
A dream that I know only God could have dreamed
You never sleep
Yet you dream dreamsI thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me or so it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams
'Til I saw your face now I'm a believer
Now there's not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love yeah I'm a believer
I couldn't leave you if I tried
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
Seemed the more I gave the less I got
What's the use of trying All I get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain

Now there's not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love yeah I'm a believer
I couldn't leave you if I tried
I saw your face

Realize Open your eyes Feel the hate
The drowned city
Poisoned By your mayor I'm sick of this
The drowned city

Permeation area replaced by a shopping scheme
Water spill down the blue no one can refuse
This city will be drown I feel it
Realize Open your eyes Feel the hate
The drowned city
Poisoned By your mayor I'm sick of this
The drowned city
Don't you realize what government did
Ruin your city with tax that they feed
The authority full of fear an greed
A profit in every policy they hold with
Realize Open your eyes Feel the hate
The drowned city
Poisoned By your mayor I'm sick of this
The drowned city
Junkie consumerism hedonistic lifestyle
Is the only progress you made
The prosperity that never coming
Your profit rises my economy falling

Can't you see I'm trying to show love is right
Oh show and tell
Just a game I play when I want to say
I love you
Girl so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do baby
These are the hands that can't help reaching for you
If you're anywhere inside 
And these are the lips that can't help calling your name
In the middle of the night 
Oh and here is the man that needs to know where you stand
Don't you know I've done all I can so decide

Girl so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way tooOn her way to work one morning
Down the path along side the lake
A tender hearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake
His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew
Poor thing she cried I'll take you in and I'll take care of you
Take me in tender woman
Take me in for heaven's sake
Take me in tender woman sighed the snake
She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk
And laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk
She hurried home from work that night and soon as she arrived
She found that pretty snake she'd taken to had been revived
Take me in tender woman
Take me in for heaven's sake
Take me in tender woman sighed the snake
She clutched him to her bosom You're so beautiful she cried
But if I hadn't brought you in by now you might have died
She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed and held him tight
Instead of saying thanks the snake gave her a vicious bite
Take me in tender woman
Take me in for heaven's sake
Take me in tender woman sighed the snake
I saved you cried the woman
And you've bitten me but why
You know your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die
Oh shut up silly woman said the reptile with a grin
You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in
Take me in tender woman
Take me in for heaven's sake
Take me in tender woman sighed the snakeI pretend that I'm glad you went away
But these four walls close in more every day
And I'm dying inside and nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside and nobody knows it but me
Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just atumblin' down
I can say it so clearly but you're nowhere around
The night are lonely the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me
How blue can I get you could ask my heart
Just like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know I'll be loving you still
The night are lonely the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me
The night are lonely the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but meWell now see C C Rider
Well now see see what you have done
Well now see C C Rider
Well now see see what you have done
Well you made me love you woman
Now your man has come
So I'm goin' away now baby
And I won't be back till Fall
I'm goin' away now baby
And I won't be back till Fall
Just might find me a good girl
Might not be comin' back at all
Well now see C C Rider
See now the moon is shining bright
Well now see C C Rider
See now the moon is shining bright
Just might find me that good girl
And everything would be alrightBetty told Dupree I want a diamond ring 
Dupree told Betty l'Il give you most anything
He said Lie down little Betty see what tomorrow brings 
It may bring sunshine may bring you that diamond ring
Then he got his pistol went to the jewelry store
Killed a policeman and he wounded four or five more
Then he went to the post office to get the evening mail 
Sheriff caught poor Dupree and put him in that old Atlanta jail
Dupree's mother said to Betty Looka' here what you done done
Made my boy rob and steal now he is gonna be hung
Betty went to the jailhouse she could not see Dupree 
She told the jailer Tell him these words for me
I come to see you baby I could not see your face 
You know I love you but I cannot take your place
Sail on sail on sail on Dupree sail on 
You don't mind sailing you'll be gone so doggone long

My mama told me she didn't like that rock and roll
I said Please Mama please Mama you just don't know I don't want
 hang up my rock and roll shoes
You know I get that feelin' ev'ry time I hear those blues

That music's got a beat that will keep you alive
The kids are rock and rollin' from 8 to 25
I don't want hang up my rock and roll shoes
Because I get that feelin' ev'ry time I hear those blues

Yes I will do my homework
Clean the yard every day
Yes I will wipe those dishes
I'll do anything you say
They say that rock and roll will soon fade away
No matter what they say rock and roll is here to stay
I don't want hang up my rock and roll shoes
because my feet start movin' ev'ry time I hear those blues

They say that rock and roll will soon fade away
No matter what they say rock and roll is here to stay
I don't want hang up my rock and roll shoes
 because I get that feelin' ev'ry time I hear those blues
because my feet start movin' ev'ry time I hear those blues

are you dead or alive
whats going on inside your mindWell I guess I'm not the only one who has issues letting go
Cause I'm desperately trying to hold on to what's left of my past
My heart could run a marathon when I see your smile in old photographs
The look on your face screams that you're sad but don't worry darling
Those light eyes
They'll never burn out
And it seems like my idea
Of what feels like home is slipping away
Out of my hands and I keep holding I keep holding on to
Well I could tell you weren't satisfied cause I'm a fucking screw up
So here's the mess of words I've piled into a song for you
And could you tell that I'm trying
It's just my way with words is completely obsolete
And I've been thinking about letting go
And it seems like my idea
Of what feels like home is slipping away
Out of my hands and I keep holding I keep holding on to

and I keep holding I keep holding on to

and I keep holding I keep holding on to
And it seems like my idea
Of what feels like home is slipping away
Out of my hands and I keep holding I keep holding on to
And it seems like my idea
Of what feels like home is slipping away
Out of my hands and I keep holding I keep holding on toWell I hate the way that you look at me
Is this more than you can handle yet

Well I'm trying not to mess this up
It's like I'm catching shattered pieces of a broken night
that seem to revolve around you
Maybe let's fall apart
start a riot place it in our hearts
Take a step back watch the walls
crash down around me
Don't let me start this war

Dont let me start this war

So come on
Let's jump this ship
It'll make us feel alive
Cuz I won't sit and wait
For the day you change your mind
I've got your sleeve still pinned to my heart
and I'm starting to see that it's a problem

These days I wanna cut my tongue out of my mouth
cuz thoughts keep slipping out in the worst situations
Maybe let's fall apart
start a riot place it in our hearts
Take a step back watch the walls
crash down around me
Don't let me start this war
Dont let me start this war

So come on
Let's jump this ship
It'll make us feel alive
Cuz I won't sit and wait
For the day you change your mind
So come on 
Take a chance
It'll make you feel alive
It'll make you feel alive

Maybe let's fall apart
start a riot place it in our hearts
Take a step back watch the walls
crash down around me
Don't let me start this war

Dont let me start this war

So come on 
Take a chance
It'll make you feel alive
It'll make you feel aliveI have fond memories of
climbing schools at night
to get high
back when we were kids at the start
ok maybe not quite
but we were kids at heart
and we always knew
there would be a place where we
could make this feeling last
and last
not stuck in your 9 to 5 routine
another cog in the machine
yeah we always knew
This is our calling in life
this is what we dreamt about at night
when we were just kids
with stars in our eyes
Now we're all grown up
we get by but it's not enough
and we never lost our stars
It's be come clear the difference
between there and here
we're not wasting anymore time
on girls that never loved us
or a family that'll never trust us
time to leave it all behind
This is our calling in life
this is what we dreamt about at night
when we were just kids
with stars in our eyes
Now we're all grown up
we get by but it's not enough
and we never lost our stars
We all feel a little fucked up sometimes
we just need a reason
to feel alright
We all feel a little fucked up sometimes
we just need a reason
to feel alright
maybe you could be mine
This is our calling in life
this is what we dreamt about at night
when we were just kids
with stars in our eyes
Now we're all grown up
we get by but it's not enough
and we never lost our stars
Now we're all grown up
we get by but it's not enough
and we never lost our starsI don't see any other way
for you to get out of this mess and
this town is a loaded gun
with its sights on you
and you can't get out of here
Take this anyway you want to
but don't expect me to be there when you crash and burn
I've got a closet full of demons
and you're just another waiting to break free
This is the last time I kiss this city goodbye
it's the first time I get on with my life
I don't see any other way
for you to get out of this mess and
this town is a loaded gun
with its sights on you
and you can't get out of here
I knew who I was this morning
but that's changed so many times since then
These are the nights we will remember
and I'll hold onto that till the day I die
This is the last time I kiss this city goodbye
it's the first time I get on with my life fuck
I don't see any other way
for you to get out of this mess and
this town is a loaded gun
with its sights on you
and you can't get out of here
I don't see any other way
for you to get out of this mess and
this town is a loaded gun
with its sights on you
and you can't get out of here
This is the last time I kiss this city goodbye
it's the first time I get on with my
This is the last time I kiss this city goodbye
it's the first time I get on with my
This is the last time I kiss this city goodbye
it's the first time I get on with my lifeI'll gather the people with nothing but charm
When I pick up the torch you can call me your captain
We will raise our voices cause we can make it better
Yeah we will burn this town down before it's too late
Tear it down and turn the lights off
I wanna hear you scream your lungs out
Storm the streets with love and anger
It's time to let yourself
Go I Want To
Riot in the streets and make it alright
Go I Want To
Open up your eyes and start a revolution now
Are we the bad guys You will never know
We are an unknown mob you can call us Messiah
We won't be silenced we will never surrender
No not until it's changing it's never too late
Tear it down and turn the lights off
I wanna hear you scream your lungs out
Storm the streets with love and anger
It's time to let yourself
Go I Want To
Riot in the streets and make it alright
Go I Want To
Open up your eyes and start a revolution now
Go I Want To
Riot in the streets and make it alright

Tear it down and turn the lights off
I wanna hear you scream your lungs out
Storm the streets with love and anger
It's time to let yourself
Go I Want To
Riot in the streets and make it alright
Go I Want To
Open up your eyes and start a revolution nowSuddenly don't know from where you came
Like a tornado you swept me off my feet
You captured me with your esoteric charm
Too good to be true yet to real to be a dream
The excitement it's killing me
He walked up to me so close took both my hands in his
Looked me straight in the eyes stroke my hair behind my ears
He gave me a kiss on the forehead and a star up in the sky
He told me it would last forever but then he said goodbye
Repetition here we go again
It's nice to meet you I hope you feel the same
Is this real or is this that same old dream
Where I get to hold you right before you slip away
I can't take it it's killing me
He walked up to me so close took both my hands in his
Looked me straight in the eyes stroke my hair behind my ears
He gave me a kiss on the forehead and a star up in the sky
He told me it would last forever but then he said goodbyeThere's no longer pride in owning records
As a kid my parents were showing theirs off
Nowadays kids don't even know CD's
taking for granted to download it all
Remember when I could watch MTV and still have hope for humanity
The human race what a waste it's all making me sick
I'm truly scared of this reality the not knowing how it's gonna be
The Armageddon devastation is that what I'm longing for
Amateurs creating their songs on a MacBook
getting bigger hits than hardworking bands
Recording a music video without brains
major thing to show is barely naked teens
Remember when I could watch MTV and still have hope for humanity
The human race what a waste it's all making me sick
I'm truly scared of this reality the not knowing how it's gonna be
The Armageddon devastation is that what I'm longing forWe laugh at our own jokes but they're not funny at all
Seen new places played nude at a high school ball
Working hard to get the bomb to finally blow
It's the life that we chose and love faster now here we go
We danced like freakin' idiots at shows and at the mall
Waiting for a moment to do our next prank call
Called each other names smiled and played games
Making noises when you sleep these memories we want to keep
We'll root for the fat kids and eat with the nerds
Those who don't get it are nothing but turds
Let's drink until we're drunk and waste another night
The world is our playground we will all be okay
We always sing when we are in the car
We like to tell lies but we sometimes go too far
It's a fine line between what's appropriate and not
Somehow we're always pushing it hoping that we won't get caught
We'll root for the fat kids and eat with the nerds
Those who don't get it are nothing but turds
Let's drink until we're drunk and waste another night
The world is our playground we will all be okay
Let's drink until we're drunk drink until we're drunk
Drink until we're drunk and waste another nightA brief moment a sudden rush a boring joke
Breathing faster touch my lips I'm gonna choke
Feel you moving a sudden shiver as I move over
You're feeling moist let's do this
Come on now we're just getting started
Bring your friends and let's get excited
We aint got all night so let's do it
Don't be shy now naked is more fun
Take it off and get in the water
We will see the sun rise and then we'll do it loud
Let's do it let's do it let's do it let's do it
Let's do it let's do it let's do it
Come on now we're just getting started
Bring your friends and let's get excited
We aint got all night so let's do it
Don't be shy now naked is more fun
Take it off and get in the water
We will see the sun rise and then we'll do it loud
Your voice feels like bubbles in my ear
Every time you come near
you say you want to taste me
I won't stop you just do it
Come on now we're just getting started
Bring your friends and let's get excited
We aint got all night so let's do it
Don't be shy now naked is more fun
Take it off and get in the water
We will see the sun rise and then we'll do it loud
Let's do it let's do it let's do it let's do it
Let's do it let's do it let's do it
Come on now we're just getting started
Bring your friends and let's get excited
We aint got all night so let's do it
Don't be shy now naked is more fun
Take it off and get in the water
We will see the sun rise and then we'll do it loudDid not watch the news cause I didn't want to
hear their lies that everything is alright
The sky has lost its beauty I can barely breath
This world is melting like gold does at one thousand degrees
Let's join forces and stop this violence
We don't want our kids to live in a world where everything ends
Killing all the living things that could have saved us all
We only have ourselves to blame so let's make a change
We can form an alliance that refuses to
demolish all the things that we love and care about
Start a big demonstration help our next generation
from making the same mistakes that we did
Let's join forces and stop this violence
We don't want our kids to live in a world where everything ends
Killing all the living things that could have saved us all
We only have ourselves to blame so let's make a change
Let's stop this violence
Let's stop this violence
Let's stop this violence
Let's join forces and stop this violence
We don't want our kids to live in a world where everything ends
Killing all the living things that could have saved us all
We only have ourselves to blame so let's make a changeThis is a song for all of our broken friends
For those who didn't make it all the way
For those who disappeared in to a fantasy land
And I'm just wondering how are the drugs treating you now
We don't blame you won't hold it against you
Now and then all of us fall 
And I just wish you would let me in
So I could help you get back up get back up get back up get back up
Empty souls in white coats keep throwing pills at them
Just so they'll make it through the day
It's not to make you better just to keep you away
And I'm just wondering how are the drugs treating you now
We don't blame you won't hold it against you
Now and then all of us fall 
And I just wish you would let me in
So I could help you get back up get back up get back up get back up
Sign this form surrender you have to play by the rules
They're gonna help you to suppress it all
They'll numb your brain sedate you keep you in store for a while
And no one's wondering how are the drugs treating you now
We don't blame you won't hold it against you
Now and then all of us fall 
And I just wish you would let me in
So I could help you get back up

Having trouble fallin' asleep at night
Can't find good reasons to make an effort
To try to accomplish anything at all
I don't care cause our drummer's dead
I don't care cause our drummer's dead
I don't care cause our drummer's dead
I don't care cause our drummer's dead
I don't care cause our drummer's dead
I don't care cause our drummer's dead
Feel like I'm trapped in a room with no air
Every idea I have fails cause of you
And the devil on my shoulder's laughing
Cause I haven't yet replaced you
I don't care cause our drummer's dead
I don't care cause our drummer's dead
I don't care cause our drummer's dead
I don't care cause our drummer's dead
I don't care cause our drummer's dead

I don't care cause our drummer's dead
I don't care cause our drummer's deadOn a rotten frosty field where our dreams seemed so real
laying with my back on the ground
Lookin' up to the sky feelin' like an old elevator
all rusty and squeaky and slow
We're just playing punkrock but at the same time we are dying
We're just playing punkrock but at the same time we are dying
Stuck in a world full of hate there's no beauty
you're the prisoners of your own minds
Walking with blindfolds through your lives
missing out on the mysterious 'cause you won't open your eyes
What is there to lose Why not go all the way
What's the worst thing that could happen
If we die we die but at least first we've lived
and there's not one thing I'll regret
We're just playing punkrock but at the same time we are dying
Stuck in a world full of hate there's no beauty
you're the prisoners of your own minds
Walking with blindfolds through your lives
missing out on the mysterious 'cause you won't open your eyes
Old and alone in a hospital bed is that where you wanna end up
You had your chance but you blew it you have never truly lived at allWatch your step now don't look back now
There's a caveman lurking in the shadows boy
You won't see him you won't hear him
There's always something hiding in the shadows boy
He hunts at night camouflaged by darkness
In an alley he's setting up his trap again
Look over your shoulder and then the other one
When you think you hear the wind it's him
Hear these words it's no joke
Stay away from the caveman I said stay away from the caveman
Don't mess around you'll be safe inside
Stay away from the caveman I said stay away from the caveman
Are you scared now Cause you should be
There's a caveman lurking in the shadows girl
He'll catch you if you don't hide
There's always something hiding in the shadows girl
So lock your door check all your windows
It's the only way if you wanna stay alive
Come a little closer this I know
When the smell reaches your nose he's close
Hear these words it's no joke
Stay away from the caveman I said stay away from the caveman
Don't mess around you'll be safe inside
Stay away from the caveman I said stay away from the caveman
Hear these words it's no joke
Stay away from the caveman I said stay away from the caveman
Don't mess around you'll be safe inside
Stay away from the caveman I said stay away from the caveman
Hear these words it's no joke
Stay away from the caveman I said stay away from the caveman
Don't mess around you'll be safe inside
Stay away from the caveman I said
stay away from the fucking caveman and lock you doors or else you're gonna dieI would have given up my life to be with you
I didn't know that you didn't feel it to
I would have treated you like my king and god
I laughed at those who said that you were odd
Hey
I know you want it you can't have it
Cause you blew it once again
Hey
You think I want you but I don't need you
Cause you screwed up once again
I wanna take a shit and shove it down your throat
I wanna snail you when I'm on my period
I'm gonna squeeze your balls 'til you admit I'm right
I'm gonna hide 'til you turn off the lights
Hey
I know you want it you can't have it
Cause you blew it once again
Hey
You think I want you but I don't need you
Cause you screwed up once again
Hey
I know you want it you can't have it
Cause you blew it once again
Hey
You think I want you but I don't need you
Cause you screwed up once again
I know you want it you can't have it
I know you want it you can't have it
I know you want it you can't have it
I know you want it you can't have itMy dad doesn't wear a shirt
He likes to walk around in a yellow skirt
He always says hi and flirts with me
Wonders if I wanna see his broccoli
He always touches my tasty banana
masturbates to Hannah Montana
He sits and watches the telly
He has a bump on his big fat belly
I don't like my dad at all I don't like my dad at all
My mom doesn't seem to like me at all
She threatened to cut off my balls
She once threw an apple in my face
I'm just glad she didn't hit my special place
She spits in my food
she acts really rude
She takes a shit on my pillow
She entered my ass with a dirty dildo
I don't like my mom at all I don't like my mom at all
I don't like my mom at all I don't like my mom at all I don't like my dad at all I don't like my dad at all
I don't like my mom at all I don't like my mom at all I don't like my dad at all I don't like my dad at all
I don't like my mom at all I don't like my mom at all I don't like my dad at all I don't like my dad at all
I don't like my mom at all I don't like my mom at all I don't like my dad at all I don't like my dad at all
He always touches my tasty banana
masturbates to Hannah Montana
He sits and watches the telly
He has a bump on his big fat belly
She spits in my food
she acts really rude
She takes a shit on my pillow
She entered my ass with a dirty dildo
I don't like my folks at all I don't like my folks at allPlease just shut your mouth now please just shut your mouth now
You think you know it all but still you have no clue
Sitting on high horses the sun orbits around you
You're a stuck up narcissist with clothes from '62
I can still see your lips move so once again I ask you
Shut your mouth now
I like you better when you're quiet
Wont you just pipe down
I like you better when you're quiet
Make no sound now
I like you better when you're quiet
I wanna gag you
And leave it in there 'til you choke
You're a real life megalomaniac a manly macho pig
Never called yourself a feminist no you would rather die
You took a shower once back when dinosaurs still lived
You smirk and gloat in disgust but no one ever cares so
Shut your mouth now
I like you better when you're quiet
Wont you just pipe down
I like you better when you're quiet
Make no sound now
I like you better when you're quiet
I wanna gag you
And leave it in there 'til you choke
Please just shut your mouth now please just shut your mouth now
Please just shut your mouth now 
Please just shut your mouth now 
Shut your mouth now
I like you better when you're quiet
Wont you just pipe down
I like you better when you're quiet
Make no sound now
I like you better when you're quiet
I wanna gag you
And leave it in there 'til you chokeShe's serving a banquet tonight
surrounded by coxcombs from a higher rank
The one's she once despised
but now has learned to ignore
I will put a smile on your face
Let it go don't be afraid
Show yourself and let me taste it
I just don't want you to waste this
He's wearing his designer suit
his bowtie's in a perfect knot
Just like every other night
he's dressed up and supposed to smile
I will put a smile on your face
Let it go don't be afraid
Show yourself and let me taste it
I just don't want you to waste this
I will put a smile on your face
Let it go don't be afraid
Show yourself and let me taste it
I just don't want you to waste this
I will put a smile on your face
Let it go don't be afraid
Show yourself and let me taste it
I just don't want you to waste thisIt's not what you'd expect
This time it's for real
And no one can make the decision for you
I can't help you now
Neither can your friends
It's up to you and only you
Only You
*Chorus*
Please don't go
Away
You've come so far
I'm asking you to stay
Please don't go
You've come too far to walk away
Please don't goI remember when it was you and me
Singing all the songs in perfect harmony
Living life with you by my side
Life in pain happiness misery it's all the same
And I'm alone again
How do you know when I'm upset
How do you know when I am low
Was it like this the whole damn time
Back when I thought that you were only mine
Good things come and old things go
My life's a misery and it goes so slow
I need you by my sideThings never seem to turn out just right
Why I don't know
Things used to move way to fast
Now it seems to move so slow
We used to do lots of cool stuff
Now I just sit and watch tv
Life used to be so exciting
What is wrong with me
*chorus*
Life is
Supposed to be spontaneous
When we're young
Everything is supposed to move to fast
But lately
Nothing seems too exciting
I've been getting lazier
Always out first and always in last
I think about the way things used to be
And then I kick myself
'cause I know it will never be the same
Sometimes I wish I was someone else
I just get so God damn bored
Sometimes I feel like I'm dead
Everything is too calm
I know it's not all in my headYou show discontent
That's fine I don't care
You're never happy anyway
You care way too much
About what everyone else thinks
They might have liked you
But then you had to change
*chorus*
Good times will come
People will change
It could be worse you could be left with nothing
Instead you've got everything you want
You're empty inside
But only you know
You'll have everything
So it will not show
Nothing's ever good enough for you
You say you're giving up
You say life's too hard
That's typical for you you never were very strong
You say it's too hard to try
And things can't get better
Like you're the only one with problems
You've always been self centeredYou knew you were rightuntil I proved you wrong
You knew you were on tracktill I showed you that you were lost
You knew that things were going goodtill I showed you what life's really like
You're not everything you thought you were
*chorus*
It's not too late not yet at least
You can always change for the better
I'm not saying it's easy but neither is life
You've noticed your mistakes it's time to make a change
You knew you weren't right  when I showed you how bad you were
You knew you were lost  but I told you how to get back on track
You knew things weren't good  when I showed you your life
Do you notice the mistakes you've madeCan you hear me calling into the night
Screaming at the skies
And calling out your name
Can you see me standing so close it hurts my eyes
And I realize
How your really so far away
Im here today
Gone tomorrow to yesterday
Wishing I were with you
Remember when
It was you and me and what couldve been
Im wishing I was still with you
*chorus*
Tell me am I dreaming
Is this a fantasy
It seems like it was never meant happen
And like you never wanted it to be
I know that this will never bring you back
I don't even know if I would want it to
What we had is gone I know
Days went so fast and nights so slow
Nights filled with dreams of youSometimes i
Feel my life
Has stopped before
It has begun
Nothing's changed
It's all the same
My life is just reruns
*chorus*
Sitting alone
In my room
Another wasted night
Another episode
Constantly repeated
Forever is my life
So I conclude that
Reality bites

Don't know if I can cope
If everyone knows
When I am down
When I am low
Was it all a lie
My whole damn life
Was everything wrong
Was nothing rightI dont' know
Why you do
Everything that you do
Seems to me
You can't see
Just how much
That you've changed
And everything
That you do
Turns my skin black and blue
And why do you
Just proceed to beat the crap out of me
*chorus*
Am I finding too much out about you
Why didn't you tell me I thought that I should know
You should have been straight with me and told me of your past
I should have told me I shouldn't have had to ask
You wear a mask
So we won't see through
You won't let us
See the real you
You're insecure
And afraid
Of what we might really think
You've got to learn
To not care too much
About what we think
And more about what you want
The real you inside
Is who we want to know
So just drop the act
And let it go
I'm sick
Of what you put me through
Trying to hide
What is really you
You are not
Fooling anyone
So drop the act
And have some funBesides your self you're all alone
The lights are on but no one's home
You're left here all alone with you fear
A cry for help no one will ever hear
For how long have you hid your pain
Tell me what's left to lose what's left to gain
You look around this place for a friend
You cant take much more you await the end
Chorus
The gun in your hand will be the cure for your pain
Empty shells on the floor and a bullet in your brain
Searching for a way out you're so sick of this game
As you search in this empty room you see no other way
This is it you say good bye
You will be strong you will not cry
You couldnt hold on any more
You couldnt find something to live for
You've no more strength to fight the fight
You close your eyes you say goodnight
To proud to hide to weak to run
Now you find your self looking down the barrel of a gun
Some body please explain to me
How did it all get to be this way
Tell me what could have been so wrong
Your life flashes before your eyes
A tear shed before you take your life
You felt out casted like you didnt belong
I tried to help but you turned away
Was there something left to do something left to say
Could I have made you made you see
I can't help feeling like it's my fault
You say you had nothing 'cause you lost it all
But you still had meThis is it
We're all going down
What would be next
What unsuspecting town
Trajedies have come and gone
What horrors lay in the dark
The echo of another shot
Another psycho makes his mark
*chorus*
This is when we all fall
When everyday kids
Are dying in hs halls
Children lying dead
It seems that everyday
Another hate filled kid
Another trajedy
What a way to end it
With drug dealers and gangs
Living amongst us
Causing violence and hate
With ignorant parents
Missing every sign
Another kid with a gun
How many more have to dieEverything that i
Was taught to be right
Was it all a stupid lie
All the things you taught
All the battles we faught
And all the unforgetable thoughts
My brain is twisted now
The room it spins around
Everything I believed has broken down
How could you lie to me
The things you said I believed
But still I will not turn my back and run away
*chorus*
But i
Can't find it in myself
To turn my back on you
No matter what you 
But i
Still don't understand
All the things you taught
All the battles we faught
Tell me
Was it all a hoax
Was it just a scam
I don't 
Still i
Can't find it in myself
To turn my back on you
No matter what you do
Your empty lies
Won't save you this time
'cause I know there's nothing on the inside
I'd agree to stay
If you agree to change
But your answer will always be no way
You were once my friend
You said friends till the end
I will still try for as long as I can
Our friendship's come undone
The burden ways a ton
You stabbed me in the back true friends stab in the front
Lucky 13We fell into a new reality
A world of glass all around
Every move could make it shatter
Every step could break it down
But I kept searching for more
A little bit more would satisfy
Just a little bit more to fill the void
Little have I known
I have cracked the glass
All around
All that running
All that searching
Everything came crumbling down
The glass shattered all around  slicing through me
I should have valued what I had
Now I beg for a second chanceI I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is all right with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you
Since since we've been together
Loving you forever
Is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue
Let's let's stay together
Lovin' you whether whether
Times are good or bad happy or sad
Whether times are good or bad happy or sad
Why why some people break up
Then turn around and make up
I just can't see
You'd never do that to me 
Staying around you is all I see

Let's we oughta stay together
Loving you whether whether
Times are good or bad happy or sadIt ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe
It don't matter anyhow
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe
If you don't know by now
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
Don't think twice it's all right
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light babe
That light I never knowed
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
So don't think twice it's all right
It ain't no use in callin' out my name gal
Like you never did before
It ain't no use in callin' out my name gal
I can't hear you any more
I'm athinkin' and awond'rin' all the way down the road
I once loved a woman a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice it's all right
I'm walkin' down that long lonesome road babe
Where I'm bound I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word gal
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice it's all rightSooner or later you're gonna come around
You think about this love you turn it down
Sooner or later you got to settle down
You think about this love you turn it down
Sooner or later

We got a thing goin'on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now
We meet every day at the same cafe
Sixthirty and no one knows she'll be there
Holding hands making all kinds of plans
While the juke box plays our favorite songs
Me and Mrs Jones
We got a thing goin'on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now
We gotta be extra careful
That do we don't build our hopes up too high
Because she's got her own obligations
And so and so do I
Me and Mrs Jones
We got a thing goin'on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now
Well it's time for us to be leaving

Now she'll go her way and I'll go mine
Tomorrow we'll meet
The same place the same time

We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong

From the mountains down to the sea

Well I come from down around Tennesee
But the people in California

And my brothers are all black and white yellow too
And the red man is right to expect a little from you
Promise and then follow through America

And lived through hardship and pain

In a war that didn't seem right
You let them come home America

Jesus loves you more than you will know 
God bless you please Mrs Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray

We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home
And here's to you Mrs Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know 
God bless you please Mrs Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray

Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It's a little secret just the Robinsons' affair
Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids
Coo coo cachoo Mrs Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know 
God bless you please Mrs Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray

Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it shout about it
When you've got to choose
Ev'ry way you look at it you lose
Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you

And do what you wanna do
See who you wanna see
Oh I oh I I trust you
I trust you in everything you do
Oh I believe in you
Oh I trust youNo I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give

For pickin' me up
Dusting me off
Making me feel like I'm living again 
I'm so glad I ran into you
If I hadn't seen you I would have been through
Our love is lucky though
Could not stand anymore

Especially listened to my problems then savin' me from misery
I just wanna say thank you baby for savin' my life
For pickin' me up
Dusting me off
Making me feel like I'm living again
I'm so glad you came along

You're the one who erased the pain
My life would never be the same
You're the very one the only one that I've been waitin' for
I want to thank you for listenin' to all of my problems
And being my shelter in and out of the storm

If if I was a sculpture Lord honey but then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelin' show
I know it's not much I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
You gave a gift Lord and I'm gon' sing it for you
And you can tell everybody that this is your song
It may be quite quite simple but that's how it's done
I hope you don't mind I hope you don't mind what I wrote down in words
words
How wonderful life is when you're in the world world world
If if if I was on a rooftop I'd kick off my shoes
I'll write a few verses and then I get the blues
But the sun's been quite quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you and people like me
I want to I want to keep turnin' on
So excuse me forgetting but these things I do Lord
You see you see I've forgotten if they're green or blue
Anyway the things is anyway the thing is what I really mean
Your are the sweetest eyes you've got the sweetest eyes
The clearest eyes I've ever seen I hope you know that
I hope you I hope you wrote back and tell everybody that this is your
song
It may be quite quite simple but now that's how it's done
I hope you don't mind I hope you don't mind but I wrote down in words
Lord words

Get back get got oh hoI saw you outside why'd you have to follow me
You wanted free ride I just pretended not to see
There was a light rain I didn't think it was that cruel
I didn't stop then it's only two blocks to the school
Steel wrapped around the pole
Hot blood streams on cold cement
Burnt flesh in the air
Don't blame me for this accident
I felt a sharp flash from the corner of my eye
I turned my head then I had the feeling something died
Steel wrapped around the pole
Hot blood streams on cold cement
Burnt flesh in the air
Don't blame me for this accident
I would've know then death was so near that day
I would've stopped then perhaps it's too late to say
I could've loved you I sat by you in history
This life is so short now you're just a memory
Steel wrapped around the pole
Hot blood streams on cold cement
Burnt flesh in the air
Don't blame me for this accident
And now you're just a memoryI've been waitin' by your window for three long nights

Won't you come out baby won't you make it all right

You say it ain't workin' but I must disagree

Is something burning out here or is it just me

And you say you just won't do it

Well you say we're just good friends

But you know it happened once

And you know it could happen again
You make me feel cheap
I've been thinkin' about you girl
Since I met you last week

I know it sounds cliche but I can't even sleep

You're actin' so cold and I'm feelin' like dying

I can't believe you're giving up
You're not even trying

And you say it's done and over

It was only for one night

But you're makin' me feel so cheap

Don't you know that I'm not that kind of guy
You make me feel cheap
And you say you just won't do it

Well you say we're just good friends

But you know it happened once

And you know it could happen again
You make me feel cheap
Well you told me I was special
And I swallowed that line

You took what you wanted
But you won't give me mine

Now I'm down and desperate
Won't you give me a hand

Tell me I more than just a one night stand

And you say it's done and over

It was only for one night

But you're makin' me feel so cheap

Don't you know
That I'm not that kind of guy
You make me feel cheap
You make me feel cheap
Unity a specialty surrounded by a mass
Individuality the sound of breaking glass
Insulated by the boys never face a threat
Try to argue with our logic see what you will
Strength in numbers power in a crowd
Strength in numbers noise is getting loud
Strength in numbers go with the rest
Strength in numbers never leave the nest
Gimme modern problems I get lost in a crowd
Friends peers family for a modern shroud
Eat up all the gossip and we go for current trends
Who needs independence when you got a lot of
Strength in numbers power in a crowd
Strength in numbers noise is getting loud
Strength in numbers go with the rest
Strength in numbers never leave the nest
Mother raised a snake a void responsibility
I lack a solid will and I lack integrity
Teenage confusions send me to the huddled flock
You think I'm ready for the world you're in for quite a shock
My insecurity leads me to dress like this hang out here
Put this music in your ear
Individuality so frightening to the crowd
Strength in numbers power in a crowd
Strength in numbers noise is getting loud
Strength in numbers go with the rest
Strength in numbers never leave the nestOh what a night to love you dear
Oh what a night to hold you near
Oh what a night to squeeze you dear
that's why I love you so
Oh what a night to love you dear
Oh what a night to hold you dear
Oh what a night to kiss you dear
That's why I love you so
I won't forget all those things you have told to me
The craze in my heart won't let me forget your love
Oh what a night to love you dear
Oh what a night to hold you near
Oh what a night to squeeze you dear
That's why I love you so
Oh what a night to love you dear
Oh what a night to want you dear
Oh what a night to kiss you dear
That's why I love you soSome people often break up over silly things
And soon they will find out all the hurt it brings
When you lose someone it's tragic
Because you must admit that you loved all the magic
I don't want to lose you
Can we skip that part baby in our lives
Can we skip that part baby in our lives oh baby
You're never going to find a lover
Who could love you more
We owe so much to each other
Let's not close the door
The price you pay for love weights so heavy
And when it's gone you weighted down with misery
I don't want to lose you
Can we skip that part baby in our lives
Stay with me
Oh can we skip that part baby in our lives
Stay with me lay with me baby
Can you see I want you in my life
I'm not saying who's wrong or who's right
So let's not go on with this madness
If we do it will only end up in sadness
Can we skip that part baby in our life
Stay with me lay with me baby
Can we skip that part baby in our life
Stay with me lay with me baby
I don't want to lose you girl
You're the best thing in this world in my life
Stay with me lay with me baby

Stay with me stay with me baby
Can we skip that part I just can't believe it girl 
I can't believe that it's over 
But I'm your man and I'll be alright 
But still the love we had stays on my mind
Lately baby I've been thinkin'
How good it was when you were here
And it ain't the wine that I've been drinkin'
For once I feel my head is clear 
But early this mornin' ha when I opened my eyes ha
That old lonesome feelin' took me by surprise ha
I guess you meant more to me than I realized
The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind

And lately girl I've been rememberin'
The good times that we used to share
My thoughts of you don't have an endin'
And the memories of you are everywhere' oh yeah oh yeah
But why should I tell you it's not your concern
You win some you lose some but I've lost and I've learned ha
Sysqo's so lonely with no place to turn at
And at the end I find yes I do
 Woowhoaohyeahyeahyeah
Girl if you were nearer 
If you had a mirror 
Maybe you could count my tears 
And if you were nearer 
It would all be clearer 
How I wish that you were here 
How I wish that you were here 

And baby girl I was tired
So I laid down to dream for a little while
But lately I've been so  so uninspired 
Without the comfort of your smile 
But I'm not complainin' huh
'Cause that's how it goes
There's always some heartache
In this world I suppose huh just a minute
But you can't imagine
But nobody knows
The love we had stays on my mind

The love we had stays on my mind 
 
The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind
 
The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind
 
The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind 

The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mindBlue blue my world is blue
Blue is my world now I'm without you
Gray gray my life is gray
Cold is my heart since you went away
Red red my eyes are red
Crying for you alone in my bed
Green green my jealous heart
I doubted you and now we're apart
When we met how the bright sun shone
Then love died now the rainbow is gone
Black black the nights I've known
Longing for you so lost and aloneWoke up this mornin'
Sunlight shinin' in my eyes
Woke up this mornin'
And I cried Lord I cried all night
Pillow's drippin' soakin' wet
From dreams of you baby
And tryin' hard to forget
But what's the use I'm hooked on you
And I miss you baby
With all my heart and soul
I I I miss you baby and I need you too
Day in and day out
I do nothin' but miss her in my life
Tryin' to find a replacement
For the love you could only provide
What am I gonna do who's gonna love me
If you don't love me like you say you'll do
Baby why couldn't you be true
Cause I miss you baby I miss you baby
You're breakin' my heart
You're tearin' it apart
What am I gonna do
I need your lovin' and your kisses too
I miss you baby I miss you baby
I I miss you baby girl what am I gonna do
I ain't got you you know I miss you baby
I miss you baby I miss you baby
You can see it all in my walk
You can tell by the way I talk
I miss you baby no sense denyin'
I miss you baby I miss you baby
I'll tell the whole wide world
I can't live without you I miss you baby
No matter who you're with tonight
If you come back I'll treat you right
I said I miss you baby
I miss you baby longin' for youSince you left life don't mean a thing
I see the moon I see the sunrise
But there's nothing in between
Sorry is the word oh but fool is what I really need
'Cause when I touched you girl I touched the queen
I touched a dream yes I did oh
I touched a dream
All I do is dream of fantasies secret thoughts of love
Secrets of you and me and when we make love
Someone unreal will have to take your place
For without your love my life is such a waste
I feel so bad because once the dream were so real
And pride won't let me hide the way it feels
To touched a dream strange as it seems oh
To touched a dream strange as it seems
Since you left life's been kind of mean
I tried another love affair but I couldn't feel a thing
Give me back the feeling take this numbness from my heart
And give these hands of mine another chance
One more chance oh
To touched a dream stranger it seems
I touched a dream strange as it seems
I touched a dream stranger as it seems
I touched a dream dream dream dream
When I touched you baby
You know babe I just realize baby
Until you walk out the door babe
I just realize I love you so much
Oh don't don't be so like that
To have a dream to have a dream like you baby
I touched a dream dream dream
Sometimes strange as it may seem
Come back one more time baby
Let me put my hands around you baby
Oh oh I touched a dream strange as it seemsOh baby
Let's pick up the pieces
And let's work this thing out
Bring back the love of yesterday
From me you stole your love away
The look of love has left your eyes
Replace the pain and despise
I can feel a chill in the air
It makes me cold
And filled with despair
This raw silence
Leaves me dangling in space
I'll sacrifice tomorrow
Just to see your smiling face
The seeds of jealousy are
Destroying the love you have for me
There's no other woman near
 you might love again
Bring back the love of yesterday
Don't turn your back on me this way
My world is all wrapped up in you
Deep in your heart you know it's true
So come on bring it back
Bring it on back now
Bring it back bring it on back girl
Bring it back bring it on back now
Bring it back bring it on back now
Yesterday your love was warm and tender
But now today you  love 
Won't you tell me what's troubling your mind
Maybe the two of us a solution we can find
I'll love you twice as strong
Til every seed of doubt is gone
There's no other woman near
 you might love again
Bring back the love of yesterday
Bring it on back now
Bring it on back now
Girl you know and I know
We had a good thing going
And all those good times
Ain't no sense in blowing
Ohh
Bring it back bring it on back now
Bring it back bring it on back now
You and me we used to be
So good so good
Now can't you see
Bring it on homeIt's not for me to say you love me
It's not for me say you'll always care
But here for the moment I can hold you fast
And press your lips to mine and dream that love will last
As far as I can see this is heaven
and speaking just for me it's ours to share
Perhaps the glow of love will grow
With every passing day
Or we may never meet again
But then it's not for me to sayzing zing zing a little song with me
I know we're not beside the Zuyder Zee
but when you're sitting by the side of me
I'd like to sing a little songIf you stayayay darling 
You make me so proud stay darling
Please stay in my corner
To the world I'd cry my love
How I love you
Honey I love you I really love you
Please please please stay darling
And I will never never let you down
Just say you'll stay
Stay in my corner
'Cause I'll need you always around
To tell me you love me
Honey love me so darling stay
There'll be times when I may fail
I'll need your love to comfort me
But if these may prevail
But just a kiss from you
Will make things sweet
MMM stay ohhhhh stay
One more time baby
But just a kiss from you
Will make things sweet
Honey I love you I love you
I love you Bonds Anderson Music  Jemakeda Music

She slides out on the floor
Dancing without a partner
Swaying on the two and four
There's a rhythm in her footsteps
And a flower in her hair
A smile on her face 'cause she's in a place
Where you know she don't have a care
She ain't looking for no lover
She ain't looking for romance
She just wants to dance

She just wants to dance

Yeah she just wants to dance

Oh she just wants to dance

Well she's moving kinda lazy

And it's all been up to me

This little girl ain't crazy

She's as wild as she is free

She can feel it in her fingers

And it moves on down her spine

And when it hits her hips she parts her lips
And you know she's feeling fine

She ain't looking for no lover

She ain't looking for romance

She wants to dance

She just wants to dance

He's the type to rob your nan of the local paper
Goes out drinking with the boys and brags about his caper
Doesn't realize that he's a clown
I bet he's just one poor man
Due to spend the rest of his life
Wasting in the canWearing braces the red white and blue
Doing what he thinks he ought to do
Used to be a punk and a mod too
Or is it just a phase he's going through

He's a Clockwork skinhead
Just a clockwork skinhead
Clockwork skinhead  got no choice
He's a Clockwork skinhead
Just a clockwork skinhead
Clockwork skinhead  One of the boys
Take him to the pub buy him a beer
Tell him what he wants to hear
Wind him up like clockwork toy
Wants to be a man but he's just a boy
I won 't say sorry for what I 've done
Won 't say sorry for having fun
I won 't take the blame
No I 'm not gonna be ashamed
I won 't say sorry for what I 've done
I don 't say sorry to anyone
Chorus
Shout it out
Shout it out
I don't give a damn 'cause
I 'm proud of what I am
I won 't say sorry to you
If it is your will you know what you can do
Won 't apologize
And I won 't put up with any of your lies
Won 't say sorry to you
You can stuff that up your asshole to
Chorus X3
Won 't say sorry for the way I act
Won 't say sorry for the manors I lack
Won 't say sorry at all
Won 't say sorry 'cause it makes me look small
Won 't say sorry for the way I act
Won 't say sorry and that 's a fact
ChorusI like breaking arms and legs
Snapping spines and wringing necks
Now I'll knife you in the back
Kick your bones until they crack

Evil evil evil evil
Evil evil evil evil
Jump up and down upon your head
Kick you around 'til your dead
Fill your body full of lead
See the roads turn to red

I don't like trendy cunts who pose
Now i'll punch you in the nose
Stick my Marten in your crotch
Don't like you you're too much
Go to football throw a brick
Get no mercy months in nick
Riot in the ghetto red alert
Guilty free innocent hurt
We've been warned of rivers of blood
See the trickle before the flood
Pretend nothing happened make no fuss
One law for them One for us
One law for them One law for them
One law for them and another law for us
No fun no homes no job no use
What else is used as an excuse
Families fighting familes looting
Next theres death then theres shooting
One law for them One law for them
One law for them and another law for us
Riots in London blame Old Bill
We've been lucky no ones killed
Violence on the streets more to follow
Freedom for those freedom fighters
One law for them One law for them
One law for them and another law for usDo you remember in 1969
Seeing all the skinheads standing in a line
Foaming at the mouth Waiting for a fight
High boots cropped hair what a fucking sight
Come back of the skinhead
Come back of the boot
People that we don't beat up
We're gonna fucking shoot
We are the new breed we will have our say
We are the new breed we ain't gonna die
Trouble east London
Trouble in the street
On the street corners
Where the gang still meets
Talking about the weekend
What they're gonna do
If you ain't careful
They are gonna do you
Come back of the skinhead
Come back of the boot
People that we don't beat up
We're gonna fucking shoot
We are the new breed we will have our say
We are the new breed we ain't gonna die
Chaos in the city
Civil war now
Skinheads taking over
Like skinheads know how
Skinhead with his boots on
Nobody's fool
Skinheads taking over
Chaos is the rule
Chaos chaos chaos don't give a toss
Chaos chaos chaos don't give a toss
Do you remember in 1969
Seeing all the skinheads standing in a line
Foaming at the mouth Waiting for a fight
High boots cropped hair what a fucking sight
Come back of the skinhead
Come back of the boot
People that we don't beat up
We're gonna fucking shoot
We are the new breed we will have our say
We are the new breed we ain't gonna die
Chaos chaos chaos don't give a toss
Chaos chaos chaos don't give a tossFrom the cradle to the grave
The Oi Boy trying to be brave
Show he's going to everyone
From his birth to his death
Got to prove that he's the best
Don't even mean it's got to me done
But he's yesterday's hero
Yesterday's hero in every way
Yesterday's hero
Yesterday's hero is forgotten today
Wants to try his hand at pop
Have a record at the top
All these records are lots of fun
Concerts city style
They all make you smile
Ain't it all a load of fun
On telly every day
Copied in every way
Fans ask for an autograph
Some kind of superman
Photographs for a fan
Don't it all make yer laughWhat will we do with a drunken whaler 
early in the morning
Weigh heigh and up she rises 
early in the morning
Stuff him in a sack and throw him over 
early in the morning
Feed him to the hungry rats for dinner 
early in the morning
Weigh heigh and up she rises 
early in the morning
shoot him through the heart with a loaded pistol 
early in the morning
Slice his throat with a rusty cleaver 
early in the morning
Weigh heigh and up she rises 
early in the morning2000 bucks would save my life
200 bucks would ease the pain
The IRS is on my case
But I refuse to let them make me go insane
2000 bucks would pay the rent
200 bucks and fourteen cents
Right about now would be enough some complement
So that I don't have to sell my instrument
I'm aware I'm aware I'm aware
That pressure makes diamonds diamonds diamonds
My mamma told me my mamma told me
That a girl's mouth doesn't get paid
2000 bucks would save my life
200 bucks would ease the pain
But I refuse I refuse I refuse I refuse
To let them make me to let them make me go insaneI'm tryna find the words to say
See I'm a little faded so excuse my feelings
Girl you know I think about you everyday
I ain't gonna lie I'm so caught in my feelings
We know that roses are red
Damn the blues skip the violets
And splash my poor heart instead
Since I've been waiting
Since I've been waiting for you
It's a hard pill to swallow I can't get over
When you walked out on me
I regret the day you told me it was over
Won't you come back to me
Reminiscing ain't good for me now
No I'm thinking about the time that I
Spent with you
Probably somewhere with another nigga
Missing me at least this is how I wanna picture it to be
Got me crazy I'm thinking shit up
On my second bottle I need to slow up
See my mirror up on my wall
Said it's too many women for me to have these withdrawals
But I can't stop waiting no
Oh I can't stop waiting
No no no no
It's a hard pill to swallow I can't get over
When you walked out on me
I regret the day you told me it was over
Won't you come back to me
Damn I can't fight the pain
Girl you promised me I could always depend on you
Whenever time is rough I would always just lean on you
Why you wanna hurt me so
Girl I can't let go
It's a hard pill to swallow I can't get over
When you walked out on me
I regret the day you told me it was over
Won't you come back to me

help
help me to renew
help me to renew
to renew with you
i came came to late it's true
my head
and my body glued
never understood
how discreet you moved
true love
i should have known
that true love
to you still blows
years
didn't spoil the fruit
in haze
it was always you
it was always you
it was always you
true love
i should have known
that true love
to you still blowsyou can't make me out
i walled something
a clue deep down
a memory inked
you can't make me out
the noise outside
don't reflect how
it's silent inside
nights bring worlds of things
i can't seize their names
edges all around
the fields i darkened once
sleep and secrets sing
an air that loses my friends
i just close your eyes
fall in your love then
run away run away from home
i will catch you underground
run away run away from home
tried but never found me
you can't make me out
transparent style
confuses now
all that should be light
blottingpaper soul
soaking up the roles
sleep and secrets sing
this air that loses my friends
this air that loses my friends
this air that loses my loses myself
run away run away from home
i will catch you underground
run away run away from home
i've tried but never found
run away run away from home
what is that flight all about
run away run away from home
where my head ain't one
sleep and secrets sing
an air that loses my friends
i just close your eyes
fall in your love and drown
fall in your love and drown
fall in your love and drown
fall in your love and drown
fall in your love
run away run away from home
i will catch you underground
run away run away from home
i've tried but never found
run away run away from home
what is that flight all about
run away run away from home
where my head ain't oneAway from all away from all i know
but you
the bruises drawn they will be gone away
through you
in your bed i'm fossilized
and even if you wake i won't
and even if you wake i won't
let you
go to our former life
to pick the wrong clues to choose
how you will recall our youth
just don't
i stay there
listening to your children stories
feeling like a kid protected
safe
in your hands
no further perspective
than a blanket of sleep
in your bed i'm fossilized
and even if you wake i won't
and even if you wake i won't
let you
go to our former life
to pick the wrong clues to choose
how will remain our youth
even if you wake i won't let you In a state of torpor
how could i slip away so far
my body dumb to your questions
was letting yours decide on the replies
this cruise in myself
did lose all my head
oh you were my lover
now for me you just have tender eyes
feel the bounds wave
on my drowned face
Masses walk in torpor
deep to the northern endless nights
everybody seem so distant
hazy paths hard to clarify
who's on my way 
who's on my way 
no one's gonna wake me
as long as i veil my heart so hard
feel the bounds wave
on my drowned face
i'm a living sleeping pill well
trying now to recall the past
anybody knows how to get there 
sink into sleep with me and watch 
who's on my way 
who's on my way 
oh you were my lover
we now have all the time for us
feel the bounds wave
on my drowned face
sleepwalk in haze
recall the place
i am the torporWhere do your nights go by 
they all start the same
they all end so wild
put a curtain to hide
what even your eyes couldn't describe
my wait crowns
my wait crowns
your vain flight
your vain flight
and i'm on my way
i'm on my way to you
i'm on my way to you
we lose ourselves in this town
we tried our best
you cannot deny
to build some place
to make things rhyme
shrouded in mist when the sun declines
my wait downed
my wait downed
your pale crown
your pale crown
will you ever stay
will you ever stay in gloom
if i'm on my way
i'm on my way to you 
i'm on my way to you you have this hands memory
my skin can't resist
discreet as gloves
in a night of robbery
they stroke my faults
and make appear a plain
where i won't fall
where i'll never be the same
you have this touch memory
printed on mine
healing my love
each time it's about to fall
all in a heart mystery
beating like a bird in hand
so close to leave
but in the end you stay with meLike the tree that bends under the wind
i stand in front of you
i doubt about the options
breaking up or boomeranging on you
go downhill and never get up
then you'll decide to run
go downhill and never get up
then you'll decide to run
bend this meat
you can't leave
it looks like you're worked by life
like wood by the sculptor
dry up til the timber catches fire
dancing on tenterhooks so long
then you'll decide to run
dancing on tenterhooks so long
then you'll decide to run
go downhill and never get up
all those ashes under my bare feet
remain on the bitumen
at the edge of us
body torsion will make us fall
while you lie by my side on the bed
my woolen heart frays
dancing on tenterhooks so long
then you'll decide to runThis word is an old rusted tool
to erase disdain
from this golden fool
swallow seeds bourne on the wind
when confusion sets in
when confusion sets in
the river drowns the straggled bride
honor is mist rolling torpedo tide
traded for sticks with a hole in her side
all saviors die
all saviors die
I shed a broken tear
the river is near
the river is near
and true love overcomes fear
redemption is here
redemption is here
the dreamland wolf is stillborn
what by blind tyranny has torn
that heartless snub once was deep love
and the snub once was deep loveOnce I woke to find a splinter
forgotten in my northern eye
scratched and scribbled to remove it
but it was shy so warm inside
tried my best to reremember
what foe or friend had placed it there
wading through the hall of records
the sand and sea beneath my hair
I was lost and floating frantic
through such piles of ancient grime
I had never learned to swim in
my own kaleidoscopic mind
always stuck to simpler waters
soft push and pull of others' tides
shallow blues and lofty hazels
the only riddles I'd dare ride
though when I confront the mirror
the look she gives me is black as night
deeper than our mother ocean
absorbing every speck of light
Once I dreamed the end of winter
was hidden in my southern eye
I clicked my teeth and asked for spring
but she was wilting closed as ice
I tried to warm her by the flame
that leaped out of my northern stare
lacing lashes through the ashes
powdered gray compressed my care
I was hidden between pages
obsessing over abstract time
between all the roman numerals
a ticking face so far from mine
kept my wings all folded under
moving within the grid and guide
but today I'll test my edges
and fall or free from off the side
with the moon I will uncover
my waxing luminescent sight
for I am just a constellation
and lightning flies this human kiteWho here can understand
My riddled airy diction
Who sees and comprehends
My other world depiction
Who begs their last demands
My flavor their addiction
Who wades through cold quicksand
My shoulder turned reception
These words are all I know now
These words are anything but true
This world just goes to show how
This world just has no need for you
Who stands firm and defends
My idealist redemption
Who still tries to pretend
My spark bends for discretion
Who wishes to amend
My loyalty affliction
Who with clarity contends
My will is a reflection
Who helplessly extends
My cartoon moon affections
Who embraced me to withstand
My rainbow mind refractions
My shoulder turned reception
These words are all I know now
These words are anything but true
This world just goes to show how
This world just has no need for youCapricious oh Capricious
lonely as the wind blows
jump the tracks between us
they're twisting up tornados
from the deepest darkened bellows
to the highest aspiration
Capricious oh Capricious
beauty at the window
break the ties that blind us
we're losing all our rainbows
to chaos and the storm
like some unwelcome guest
ever since we were breathing
since the morning we were born
fed love and evil from all sides
till the morning when we learn
how to laugh and cry in strides
how to grow then watch it burn
Capricious oh Capricious
from your mean green walls of memory
all hidden deep within your chest
long lava roads lay between us
but the cross roads
sends back its best
with a river to remind us
Capricious oh Capricious
just how lost a lover gets
without a river to remind her
she's likely to forget
and just roll on past tomorrow
like some unwelcome guest
ever since we were feeling
since the evening we were one
fed love and evil from all sides
till the morning when we learn
how give and take in strides
how to grow then watch it burnAre answers just a fairy tale
To keep us chasing our own tail
Despite the lovers we may win
In search of truth we're bound to fail
And with every fruitless sin
The devil's there to let us in
A warm embrace for the cold and frail
Teach us how to drive the nail
And questions build our cross
Since we only speak in Braille
We all repent at our own cost
And our meaning is forever lost
Virgin Mary stands in cold hail
Her orphaned babes blind on the rail
Train wreck vision locked in a box
Surrounded us blinded by grey veils
Swim alone in foreign flocks
Through vast waters the thirst still knocks
Hunger in each exhale
Starvation in every fake gale
And though no two minds seem the same
We're all one in the belly of the whale
Identity the source of shame
And lies the nature of the gameThe leaves are on the wind tonight
the city grinds and hums
I cat tongued to pass through the glow
of sodium lights on a concrete wall
through the factories and railroad tracks
through shopping carts and trash
where bottles broke in fits of mirth
where weeds spring forth from trampled earth
my mouth is sewn my hands are bound
my dreams are cased in stone
my memory in charcoal draws a flower
the wind is blowing through the trees
casting leaves upon the night
a train is passing through the yard
pulsing light between its cars
and from each box car's passing door
a ghastly vision peers
it sends a tremor through my skin
for in each car I see again
specter watching from beyond
that's bound to ride like me
reappearing in each passing car
it's eyes sunk in like dying stars
and wherefore has this vision come
that none should see but me
it's face like what my mirror shows
displays my fate from choices chose
fate not sealed not carved in stone
still a different path it excludes
choices yet to make with trains
to ride or lay down on the main
I feel a chill like shards of rime
and light a cigarette
I shudder because freedom found
and maybe it's time to leave this town
so puttin' out my cigarette
I take my pack up from the ground
in the wind that blows before a rain
the fated one runs toward a trainI've got this pistol
loaded ready for the game
but I can't seem to shoot it
cause I don't know where to aim
but I guess that in the end
everything's the same
I just want to say I'm sorry
for all the faith I lack
I just want to see how you look when you
turn to face the facts
I've got a canvas
whiter than a blind eye's gaze
I can't seem to stroke it
cause I'm limited in paints
but I guess that in the end
everything's a waste
I just need some time to think
oh no don't leave me here alone
I just want someone to fill in
all the lonely space unshown
I've got a voice
always rememberin' the words
I can't seem to sing em
cause it don't ring like the birds
but I guess that in the end
nothing's truly heard
I don't need to justify
my psychotic reveries
I just want to cultivate
these sparking new sewn seedsI stand I stood I'm standin'
but it ain't doin' me no good
I wait here on this agate road
while the robbers ask me where it goes
I suppose I can tell you where it goes
goes to the king but the king is dead
black flies are buzzin' round his head
I've been here so long staring at the stone
I can't remember how to get home
swim in the river dive in the well
I don't wanna go to heaven
but I will go to the water
or in the waterway
I will find it what a glorious day
I swim I swam I'm swimmin'
and I love who I am
because I'm in the water
in the waterway
and I have found it what a glorious dayYou twinkle and a'sparkle like a new barbed wire
you crackle and pop like a wet funeral pyre
and when the storm comes you whirl like garbage and leaves

in the street
oh I'd like to meet you
but maybe not today
yeah I'd like to meet you
but then run away
and oh I'd like to meet you
cuz the things we'd say
Hey hey
Hey
um Hi
look at this apple with one bite bit
and look at this banana vertically split
and look at this tangerine yeah with very loose skin
It all comes off in one piece
peace peace
peace for mankind
cheese cheese
cheese for mousekind
and these these
these are mine but you can have someWe're sipping daisies sweet things
and playing for thin dimes
and that old whisper river
is a hopscotch back in time
but now the time has lost its mind
so we'll just sing and watch it all unwind
We're shooting nonsense cap guns
I'm aiming for your eye
and that odd look you give me
is a heartbeat back in time
but now the time has lost its mind
so we'll just sing and watch it all unwind
We cast in mystic footprints
on sand our highway lines
and every street we walk here
is a wander back in time
but now the time has lost its mind
so we'll just sing and watch it all unwind
We're winking riddle word games
I'm biding for a rhyme
and every sign we find here
is an arrow back in time
but now the time has lost its mind
so we'll just sing and watch the sea rise
and the broken watch rewindThis flower is
Onto ice cubes
And one
That bone
And window view
To much of anything
is never a good thing
Only blooms
For what it loves
I am what I am
Just not what I was
Not sure of anything
And I don't feel a thing
I'm letting go
Of everything I've ever known
I know
I was if this unorthodox
And bloom bloom
The summer has been
Thick and dry
The same as the
Seep in my eye
To much of anything
is never a good thing
I cause a smile
like a will win
Its just smoke and mirrors
I bet you can't
Stand for this
I'm not sure anything
And I don't feel a thing
I'm letting go
Of everything I've ever known
I know
I was if this unorthodox
And bloom bloom
Let it go letting it go
I'm letting go
Let it go I'm letting go
Let it go I'm letting go
I'm letting go

I'm letting go
of everything I've ever known
I known
I was if this unorthodox
And bloom bloom
I know
I was if this unorthodox
And bloom bloom
THE ENDYour sister started
Pulling her hair up
And when she pulled up next to me
I pretended the sun was in my eyes
Instead of pretending she was alone
But I quicked a canker sore in the way
Thinking about you
everyday
When I was young death to me ah
And I was swallowed by a world that I don't feel a part of
By a world that I don't feel a part of anymore
That old man stood in front of your body
And send the look wouldn't call you dead
I watched your parents write him a check
Their lips went no when kissed your forehead
And they catch your room exactly the same
Obviously thinking about you
Everyday
When I was young death to me ah
And I was swallowed by a world that I don't feel a part of
By a world that I don't feel a part of anymore
Smashed several pumpkins in her drive way
That I ran through though know she lefted on your grave
It's been fifteen years
Your the reason I'm not close anybody
I really think you were then somebody
When I was young death to me ah
And I was swallowed by a world that I don't feel a part of
By a world that I don't feel a part of anymore
When I was young death to me ah
And I was swallowed up by a world that I don't feel a part of
By a world that I don't feel a part of anymore
HOLY CRA THATS SADI'm glad that you still came by
But it wasn't really icy outside
I was just in one of my moods
Now we're laughing on the sheets in my room
My mother she slept on the couch
While deer hooves made holes in the ground
Maybe my brothers blood
Dripped on me from the top bunk
I keep telling myself
Everybody's hell's better than my own
And my hell's my own
The neighbors were young back then
And their homes were new to them
Now they can't sleep at night
Cause their husbands are dying inside
Their husbands are dying inside
I keep telling myself
Everybody's hell's better than my own
And my hell's my own
These houses are headstones
These basements they are graves
After getting out I
I never thought I would want back in
I want back in
I keep telling myself
Everybody's hell's better than my own
And my hell's my own

And my hell's my own
Open your fucking eyes
Let see this world is burn
It's time to pray for death
No one alive

Today it's time to close my eyes
Because i'm scared to see myself
I feel the angels in the sky
Is falling down onto me

This punishment it's time to face it now
Until i die if my blood is going down to hell
You shall die i hope you never alive
It's time to say goodbye i let your
Soul is burn Disciples Of Darkness
Salute our mass

Today it's time to close my eyes
Because i'm scared to see myself
I feel the angels in the sky
Is falling down onto me
I won't forgive you

So hold my hand right now
I pull you out and after this
I kill you today
It's time to pray for death
There is no forgiveness
The new beginning we are

So what's your plan 
I want to see this world is suffering
Right Now

That you're a stranger
A stranger in my heart

To tell the world
That you're the you're and you're everything of mine
And you'll never

You're a liar and you're a cheat
And I don't know why
I let you do these things to me
My friends keep telling me
That you ain't no good
But oh but they don't know
That I'd leave you if I could
I guess I'm uptight
And I'm stuck like glue
'Cause I ain't never
I ain't never I ain't never no no 

Some time ago I thought
You had run out of fools
But I was so wrong
You got one that you'll never lose
The way you treat me is a shame
How could ya hurt me so bad
Baby you know that I'm the best thing
That you ever had
Kiss me once again
Don't ya never never say that we we're through
'Cause I ain't never
Never Never no no 

I can't sleep at night
And I can't even fight
I guess I'll never be free
Since you got your hooks in me
Whoa oh oh

I ain't never loved a man
I ain't never loved a man baby
Ain't never had a man hurt me so bad
No
Well this is what I'm gonna do about itTake me to heart
And I'll always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted leaving love unsure
Makes will power weak
And temptation strong
A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a dorightallday woman 
You've got to be a dorightallnight man 
Yeah yeah
They say that it's a man's world
But you can't prove that by me
And as long as we're together baby
Show some respect for me
If you want a dorightallday woman 
You've got to be a dorightallnight man Billy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gathered around and started talkin'
That's when Billy would take me walkin'
Out through the back yard we'd go walkin'
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows to my surprise
The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was he was ooh yes he was
Bein' good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweettalkin' to me
He'd come'n tell me Everything is all right
He'd kiss and tell me Everything is all right
Can I get away again tonight
The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was he was ooh yes he was 
How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all mine
Learnin' from each other's knowin'
Lookin' to see how much we've grown and
The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was he was oh yes he was

He was the sweettalkin' son of a preacher man

Was the son of a preacher man

Was the sweettalkin' son of a preacher manBaby baby sweet baby

And give you just a little time
Wait on me baby
I want you to be all mine

Since you've been gone baby

That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me at the dark end of the street you and me
I know that time's gonna take its toll
We have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
Oh but our love keeps a coming on strong
Steal away to the dark end of the street you and me
They're gonna find us yes they're gonna find us
They're gonna find us oh some day
You and me at the dark end of the street you and me
And when the daylight hours roll around
And by ten we're both downtown
If we should meet you just walk right on by
Oh my darling now please don't you cry
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street you and meSometimes you love me like a good man oughta
Sometimes you hurt me so bad my tears run like water
You get me out right before your friends
Then you disown me baby until we're alone again
Your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw baby
Your love is like a see saw
Goin' up an' down all around like a see saw
Sometimes you tell me you don't need my sweet candy man
And then sometimes baby never know where I stand
You lift me up when I'm on the ground
But as soon as I get up child you send me tumbling down
Now your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw baby
Your love is like a see saw
Goin' up down all around it's like a see saw
When I kiss you and I like it
And I ask you to kiss me again
When I reach at you you jump to lean out of sight
You change just like the wind
That ain't right that ain't right that ain't right
That ain't right baby
Your love is like a see saw

I have seen the specter he was been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses I have been removed
Holy Moses I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction
I think I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness
But it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses I have been deceived yes I have
I'm going back to the border
Where my affairs my affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
I've been poisoned from my head down to my shoes
Yes I have
Holy Moses I have been deceived
Holy holy
Holy Moses can we live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease

If you won't let me
It ain't no way
For me to give you all you need
If you won't let me give all of me
I know that a woman's duty
Is to help and love a man
And that's the way it was for them
Oh but how can I how can I how can I

The blues walked in this morning
And circled round my lonely room
I didn't know why I had
That sad and lonely feeling
Until my baby called and said we're through ooo
Woah yesterday this time I sang a love song
But today I'm singin' the blues
Mmm it strikes me kind of funny
How love can be this way
We were lovers last night honey
But I'm alone again today
It strikes me kind of funny
How fate can be unfair
I come out on the losin' end
In every every love affair
Yes it must be must be written for me
That I should be the one be the one to always lose
For yesterday yesterday this time I sang a love song
Oh oh but right now I sing the blues oh yeahDoo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
There was a rose I knew I met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Ashamed of the way you lied played with the truth hey hey
Mmm she never knew what hit her
Steal her honey then forget her
A rose
She wears a flower
Tryin' to forget about you
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin' you hold the power
Now believe me when I tell you that I've been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you and sees nobody else
And now you're so tough tryin' to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin' tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings
Oh oh yeah
When she faces the mirror yeah
She's cryin' you can't hear her
Now the rose is still a rose
She wears a flower tryin' to forget about you
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl you hold the power
See a rose is still a rose
Baby girl you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin' you hold the power
Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see your all today
When you know it'll come tomorrow
Tough to be but life ain't over
Just because your man is gone
Girl love yourself and love to love
Cause without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl you hold the power
See a rose is still a rose
Baby girl you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin' you hold the powerDon't play that song for me
'Cause it brings back memories
The days that I once knew
The days that I spent with you

Into my eyes
When I began

Just like a child
These tears of mine

And if you don't think
If you don't think that you'll be home soon
Baby I'm going to drown oh yeah in my own tears
Here without you 
I get so lonely and I sure get blue  yes I do
It seems to keep rainin' 
Rainin' and raining more and more 
Oh here without you baby
I sure get lonely and I get so blue
And every time I look around it's rainin'
More and more and more and more and more
Oh why can't you Why can't you
Why can't you come on home 
Because I don't wanna be I don't want to be here all alone
Listen if you don't think 
If you don't think that you're coming home soon 
Like this evening
I believe I'm gonna drown this morning
I tell you that I'm gonna gonna drown this evening
And oh It's sure gonna get bad in the midnight hour

Oh don't let him do it don't let him do it
I don't wanna drown in my own tears
When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true 
Showed them all I had faith in you
I kept on saying
Oh no not not my baby 
Oh no not my sweet baby 
He's not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies 
My mama told me when rumors spread 
There's truth somewhere and I should use my head 
But I didn't listen to what she said
I stood right there and I kept right on saying
Oh no not my baby 
Oh no not my sweet baby
'Cause he's not like those other boys
Who play with hearts like they were toys

You might have had a lastminute fling
But I'm so sure it didn't mean a thing
Because yesterday you gave me your ring
And now I'm so glad that I kept on saying
Oh no not not my baby 
Oh no not my sweet baby 
He's not like those other guys
Who lead you on who tell you lies 
Oh not not my baby 
Oh no not my sweet baby
Oh no not my baby
Oh no not my sweet babyEverybody get in the groove and let the good times roll
I'm gonna stay here till I soothe my soul
If it take all night long
Yeah it might be one o'clock and it might be three
Time don't mean that much to me
I ain't had that much fun since I don't know when
And I might not feel this good again
Oh get in the groove and let the good times roll
I'm gonna stay here till I soothe my soul
If it take all night long
Yeah all night
Takes all day
All night
And all day
I'm gonna get in the groove and let the good times roll
Stay here till I soothe my soul
If it takes all night long yeah
It might be one o'clock and it might be three
I don't care 'cause time means nothin' to me
I ain't been swingin' since I don't know when
And I might not be swingin' this way again
Oh get in the groove and let the good times roll
You can stay here 'til you soothe your soul
If it takes all night long yeah
All night and all day
All night and all day
I'm gon' stay here I ain't gonna move
Come on soul brotha help me find the groove
I don't care who's knockin' on the doorI read her letters
And I saw her picture
And I smelled her cheap perfume hmm
It must have come from you
How could you touch her
Lay down beside her
Well there just ain't no excuse
You shouldn't have been so loose
I saw the telephone bill
You must be out of your mind
If you think you can smooth it over
Then you're wasting your time
Well I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really really really really
hurt me this time
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy busy busy busy thinkin' that I'm gonna mess around some time
You're such a liar
You took her and her children
Out for the afternoon
While I was sittin' waitin' on you
How could you do it
You should've been here with me
You just couldn't do it
You had to be in the streets uh
Well I heard through the grapevine
You've been messin' around
When you thought you were gettin' over
That's when my baby I found oh
Well I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really really really really hurt me this time 
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy busy busy busy
thinkin' that I'm gonna mess around some time
I gave my heart gave my time
Gave my soul 'cause love was blind
I can't explain this poor excuse
Of a man of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent washed your clothes
Cooked your food and I only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess I'm in love
Well I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget

Cause you really really really really
'hurt me this time

And I guess I can go on although I must admit 
I've been busy busy busy busy thinkin' that
I'm gonna mess around some time

I gave my heart gave my time
Gave my soul 'cause love was blind
I can't explain this poor excuse
Of a man of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent I washed your clothes
Cooked your food and I only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess I'm in love
Well I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really really really really
hurt me this time

And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy busy busy busy
thinkin' that I'm gonna mess around some time
I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget

'Cause you really really really really
hurt me this timeIn this world it's hard

I know sometimes it's been so tough
we've been so close to giving up
but our love's so strong and we keep holding on

It's easier to walk away
it takes a lot of love to stay
we've got all the love it takes
we know there's a brighter day
Through the storm
through the tears
you and I
I know we can survive
To the day
through the night
if we try we can keep it alive

 of you

Thinking of you
Daydreaming
DaydreamingThere is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in his soul
And starts a fire there and then he loses control
I'm goin' to beg his pardon yeah
He's going to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows in his garden
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
He's going to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows in his garden
With eyes as black as coal that look down in his soul
And starts a fire there and then he loses control
And I'm goin' to beg his pardon yeah
He's going to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows in his garden
Lalala lalala lalalala
Lalala lalala lalalala
Lalala lalala lalalala
Lalala lalala lalalalaThe moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup
I say a little prayer for you
While combing my hair now
And wondering what dress to wear now
I say a little prayer for you
Forever forever you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever forever we never will part
Oh how I'll love you
Together together that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only be heartbreak for me
I run for the bus dear
While riding I think of us dear
I say a little prayer for you
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee breaktime
I say a little prayer for you
Forever forever you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever forever we never will part
Oh how I'll love you
Together together that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only be heartbreak for meWhen I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
Let it be let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer let it be
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer let it be
Let it be let it be Yeah
There will be an answer let it be
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on until tomorrow let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
Let it be let it be
There will be an answer let it be
Let it be let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it beI'm in love yes I am

Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him and listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
He sang as if he knew me
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me
As if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

Seems all we do now is treat each other mean
We used to be so understadning
About each others ways
Since we've come together
Seems all we do is get in each other's way

Better Friends than lovers 
We used to have a ball
Let's not wait until the friendship breaks
Cause we don't have to lose it all
Better friends than lovers
Honey can't you see
You need you and I need me
So its time now to set each other free
You get mad when guys stare at me
And I'm mad when girls look
I don't believe we're ready now
For living by this book
The things we love about us
Are the things we seem to hate
When we go out for good times
We just come home with big headaches

We were both out there fishing
We weren't ready to care
And no room in our hearts for love
To love each other back

We come home with big headaches

Nobody but you baby 
Nobody but you your love to be by my side
Your heart to be by my guide told your mind
I love you baby nothin' but your soulLike a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights
Consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally
Somehow I made it through the heartache
Yes I did I escaped
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith kept my faith
When the river was deep
I didn't falter
When the mountain was high
I still believed
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me no no
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me
With and endless desire
I I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
Like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over
One touch and you set me free
No I don't regret a single moment
No I don't looking back
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh I just laugh
When the river was deep
I didn't falter
When the mountain was high
I still believed
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me
So we were drawn together through destiny
I know this love we share was meant to be
Knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me
I didn't falter
I still believed
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me
Knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me
I didn't falter
I still believed
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me
Knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me
I didn't falter
I still believed
It didn't stop me
Knew you were waiting

Vacant heart of mine

And let you go
But baby
I don't know what to do
I can't see myself
Going away to stay
Whoa no I can't
See myself leaving you
You've been running around
With every girl in town
Yes you have
If I just had the power
I'd put you right down
Whoa oh my love
I don't know what to do
Cause I can't see myself
Going away to stay
Oh no I can't
See myself leaving you no
True love
Is so hard to find
Tell me tell me
That I've got mine
If I go
Searching for another
I'd just be wasting
My time yeah hey

Because I love you

Cause I can't see
Myself leaving you
Whoa oh oh oh
I can't see myself
Leaving you no
I can't see myself
Leaving you
Whoa no
I can't see myselfIt's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mindApril fools April fools
April fools April fools
April fools April fools
April fools April fools
In an April dream once you came to me
You smiled I looked into your eyes
And I knew I'd be loving you and
Then you touched my hand
And I knew April dreams could come true
Are we just April fools
Who can't see all the danger around
Are we just April fools
I don't care true love has found us now
April fool true love's found us now 
April fool true love's found us now
Little did we know where the road would lead
Here we are a million miles away
From the past travelin' so fast and
There is no turning back
If our sweet April dream doesn't last
Are we just April fools
Who can't see all the danger around us
Are we're just April fools
I don't care true love has found us now
April fool true love's found us now 
April fool true love's found us now
April fool true love's found us now 
April fool true love's found us now
Little did we know where the road would lead
Here we are a million miles away
From the past travelin' so fast
And there's no turning back
If our sweet April dream doesn't last
Are we just April fools
Who can't see all the danger around us
Are we're just April fools
I don't care true love has found us now
April fool true love's found us now
April fool true love's found us now 
April fool true love's found us now 
April fool true love's found us now
April fools April fools
April fools April fools
April fools April fools
April fools April fools
April fool true love's found us now 
April fool true love's found us now 
April fool true love's found us now 
April fool true love's found us nowIf you had a dollar
And I had a dime
I wonder could I borrow yours
As easy as you could mine
Because when you need my love
And I give time after time
And turn around to find me no returns
Then my friend you've used my dimes
If there's water in the pitcher
And we both need a drink
To stay alive my darlin'
I'd need less water than you think
My love my love these things I swear I say are true
And all I'm really saying is be as good to me as I am to you
Oh yeah
Listen to this
Some people want
But they don't wanna give
They can do all of the wrong in the world
And got the nerve to not understand the meaning of loving me
Starting today
Tomorrow and forevermore
If you can't find it in your heart to do for me
Then baby just don't darken my front doorOh baby
Oh oh babe
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh baby
Love was always supposed to be
Something wonderful to me
To watch it grow inside yourself
To feel your heart beside itself
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad

Sometimes it hurts to even laugh

Sometimes the pain is just too much oh oh
And it hurts like hell that's the way it feels
True love it has no hiding place
It's not something you just put away
It's always there inside of you
Oh and it shows in everything you do
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad

Sometimes it hurts to even laugh

Sometimes the pain is just too much oh oh oh
And it hurts like hell that's the way it feels
Oh oh oh oh
Here we are the two of us
So full of love so little trust
But dying for some tenderness
Ohh but too afraid to take the step
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad

Sometimes it hurts to even laugh

Sometimes the pain is just too much
And it hurts like hell that's the way it feels
I know if there is any chance
For us to find our happiness
We've got to learn to let it go
Ohh forget all the pain we know
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad

Sometimes it hurts to even laugh

And it hurts like hell that's the way
Oh baby that's the way it feels
Yeah yeah oh yeahThis is my same old coat
These are my same old shoes
It was the same old me
With a same old blues
Oh then you touched my life
Just by holding my hand
And when I look in the mirror
I see a brand new girl oh me
Just because of you 
Just because of you woah
Just becasue of you 
Just because of you
I've got the same old friends
And they've got the same old shins
I tell the same old jokes
And I get the same old grins
But now the joke is on you
It happened somehow with you
Everyday of my life
I'm as fresh as morning dew
Just because of you 
Just because of you woah
Just becasue of you oh 
Just because of you
I go to the same old places 
I see the same old faces
I look at the same old sky 
See it all with a brand new light
I got brand new boy 
And I got me a brand new smile
Since I found you baby
I got me a brand new starI don't want nobody
Always
Sittin' around me and my man

If you should decide to trap me once more
All you got to do all you got to do is knock on my door
And I said I said I'm taking you backRockabye your baby with a Dixie melody
When you croon
Croon a tune from the heart of Dixie
And just hang my cradle mammy mine
Right on that Mason Dixon line
And swing it from Virginia
To Tennessee with all the heart that's in ya

Feel a sermon comin' on me
The topic will be sin and that's what I'm ag'in'
If you want to hear my story
The settle back and just sit tight
While I start reviewin'
The attitude of doin' right
You've got to accentuate the positive
Eliminate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mister InBetween
You've got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
Have faith or pandemonium's
Liable to walk upon the scene
To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale Noah in the ark
What did they do just when everything looked so dark



Don't mess with Mister InBetween 
Don't mess with Mister InBetween




You got to ac centtchuate the positive
Eliminate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mister InBetween
No don't mess with Mister InBetweenI've looked around all over town

I've looked around all over over
I just can't find nobody nobody like you
Tears seem to fall when I'm away oh when I'm away from you
And I've tried to understand the reason why
And now I know it's all it's all because I love you I love you so much
My heart is yours until the day that I die
And oh why don't you hold me
Hold me and never never let me go
Why don't you why don't you love me love me
And vanish all thoughts of sorrow
I love you I love you just can't find nobody like youJust for a thrill
You changed the sunshine to rain
Just for a thrill
You filled my heart with pain
To me you were my pride and joy
But to you I was merely a toy
A plaything that you could toss around at will
Just for a thrill
You made my life one sad song
Just for a thrill
You just led me along
Although you're free and havin' your fun
To me you're still the only one
Cause you made my heart stand still
Just for a thrill
Although you're free and havin' your fun
To me you're still the only one
Cause you made my heart stand still
Well it was just for a thrill
And baby you you made my heart stand still
Just for a thrillWhat is romance
Without the one you love
Well it's heartbreak and misery
Without the one you love
You fool yourself and say
I'll forget
And knowing all the time that it's not so
Playing the lonely role of
Pagliacci
Crying all day and sad and hurting and much more
Life can seem so cruel
Without that one you love
You're like a dying rose of summer without the one you love
One telephone call 
One life 
Could mean a world of difference 
Just like lovebirds you never
You'll neverever ever ever know
But life can seem so lonely without the one you love
One one telephone call 
You know that charge'll brighten me one line of change 
All of this could mean a world of difference 
Just lovebirds you'll nevereverever know
One life can seem so lo so lonely
Without the one you loveBaby here I am

Are you falling out of love
Baby have you had a change of heart
Are you falling out of love
Tell me is there someone new that you're dreaming of
Are you falling out of love

We just talk and talk but we get nowhere
All we do is talk and get nowhere
Are you falling out of love

Falling out of loveThat's life that's what people say
You're riding high in April
Sitting on the ground in May
But I believe I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top yeah in June
I tell you that's life and as funny as it may seem
Some people really get big kicks
From stepping and walking on your dreams
But I'm not gonna let it get me down
Because this big world of ours is going to keep spinnin' around
I've been a puppet pauper pirate
Poet pawn and a queen
I've been up I've been down
I've been over I've been out
And I learned one thing
That every time I see myself fallin' flat on my face
This is what I do
Say get up girl oh get up girl oh get back in the race
Oh that's life
I'm gonna deny it
I really thought of quitting once or twice
But my heart wouldn't buy it
And if I thought it was worth one single try
This is what I'd do
I'd call American Airlines get dead on a jet and I'd fly
I've been a puppet pauper pirate
Poet pawn and a queen
I've been up I've been down
I've been over I've been out
And I learned one thing
That every time I see myself fallin' flat on my face
This is what I do
Say get up girl oh listen to yourself oh get back up in the race
Oh that's life
And I'm gonna deny it
I really really thought of quitting once or twice
But my heart just wouldn't buy it
And if I thought it was worth a single try
I'd just roll myself up in one of those big balls
And I'd lay right down and I'd ahhOnly you
Can hear my soul
Serenade
I want to be free to fly away and sing to the world
About my soul serenade my soul serenade
When you're not around there's a lonely sound
In my soul serenade in my soul serenade
Everyone but you adores me
But do you know pretty soon they bore me
Let me tell you right now that they bore me
They bore me with their pretty little words
Those pretty little words of devotion
But oh let me tell you right now
My message to 'em this evening
Is they can jump in anybody's ocean
Because only you hear my soul
My soul serenade my soul serenade
Oh my soul serenade my soul serenadeBaby baby baby this is just to say
How much I'm gonna miss you
But believe while I'm away
That I didn't mean to hurt you
Don't you know that I'd rather hurt myself

Baby baby baby  think of me sometimes 
Because if loving you was so wrong  then I'm guilty of this crime

I'm bewildered I'm lonely and I'm loveless
Without you to hold my hand 
If you'd just understand 
Those that we love we foolishly make cry
Then sometimes feel it's best to say goodbye goodbye
But what's inside can't be denied
The power  the power of love is my only guide
Baby  baby 
Baby baby baby baby baby baby this is just to say
Just how much I'm really gonna miss you
But believe while I'm away

That I really didn't mean I didn't mean I didn't mean to hurt you
Don't you know that that I'd rather hurt myself 
Baby I need you I need you I need you
If I did you wrong if I did you wrong 
I need you I need you I need you
If I did you wrong If I lose this dream 
I don't know what I'm gonna do
If I lose this dream 
I'm dreaming about for me and you
If it goes away I might as well hang it up
'Cause I don't know
If I have the heart or mind
To make it true to help it grow
And I only know
I only know I only know
If I lose this dream 
It's goodbye love and happiness yes
You're the one I need
I don't want a love that second best
There've been things all of my life
I wanted to do that made me blue
Help me hold onto this dream
For sometimes dreams often come true
And they all come true they all come true
For me and you

Solo Psalm 2316
The LORD is my shepherd I shall not want
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures
He leadeth me beside the still waters
He restoreth my soul
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil
for thou art with me
thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies
thou anointest my head with oil
my cup runneth over
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life
and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home
The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures
Yea when this flesh and heart shall fail
and mortal life shall cease
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begunI have heard of a land on the far away strand
'Tis a beautiful home of the soul
Built by Jesus on high where we never shall die
'Tis a land where we never grow old
Never grow old never grow old
In a land where well never grow old
Never grow old never grow old
In a land where well never grow old
In that beautiful home where well never more roam
We shall be in the sweet by and by
Happy praise to the King through eternity sing
'Tis a land where we never shall die
Never grow old never grow old
In a land where well never grow old
Never grow old never grow old
In a land where well never grow oldAh wholy holy

Oooh oohPrecious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious father loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appear
In the stillness of the midnight
Echoes from the past I hear
Oldtime singing gladness bringing
From that lovely land somewhere
As I travel on life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder hope grows fonder
Precious memories flood my soulWhen you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
Is the golden sky
And the sweet silver song of the lark
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on walk on with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk aloneLet us all

James Moody you can come on in man
And you can blow now if you want to
We're through
The first snow in Kokomo
Off an Indiana highway I was on my way to Kokomo
A funny friend named Chuck slipped and bumped his head 
And as we picked him up asked us had his nose turned red
That was the first snow in Kokomo
Kenny learning to blow his horn
I was feeling right up to it
Could it be done yes I could do it
That first snow in Kokomo
Jimmy Dee playing a bass he was learning to play
Applegate discovered a coronet almost right away
Reggie expecting a baby and was Freddy kinda blue
That was the first snow in Kokomo
Jimmy Dee has put his bass away 
And I wonder if Applegate ever learned to play
Kenny is really really blowing his horn
And a baby named Moishe has been born 
Freddy's getting ready to make things right 
Since that first snow
That first snow in Kokomo 
The first snow in Kokomo

My arms grow cold aching for you
No one can take your place
Darling in my embrace
I'll never be free
And when my lips burn with desire
No other kiss puts out the fire
Though I may try and try
No one can satisfy this longing in me
I'll never be free from your smile so tender
The sweet surrender in your eyes
How can I be free when I still remember
How you could thrill me with a sigh
Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains when we're apart
Each kiss I gave to you
Made me a slave to you
I'll never be freeYou're a no good heart breaker
You're a liar and you're a cheat

Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you life was so unkind
But your the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
And if I make you happy I don't need to do more
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman
Oh baby what you've done to me
You make me feel so good inside
And I just want to be close to you
You make me feel so alive
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
You make me feel
You make me feelThat's all that's all I want from you
That's all that's all I want from you
That's all that's all I want from you
That's all that's all I want is a little bit of love
That slowly grows and grows 
Not one that comes and goes that's all I want from you
 a sunny day with hopes up to the sky
A kiss and no goodbyes that's all I want from you
Don't let me down oh show me that you care
Remember when you give you always get your share
Don't let me down I have no time to waste
Tomorrow may not come  when dreamers dream too late
A little love that slowly grows and grows 
Not one that comes and goes that's all I want from you
Don't let me down show me that you care
Remember when you give you always get your share
Don't let me down I have no time to waste
Tomorrow may not come dreamers dream late
A little love that slowly grows and grows 
Not one that comes and goes that's all I want from you
 baby that's all 
Baby 
 ooh baby
It was you
You made me love you
It was you
You made me need you
Darling darling
You made me

Hey baby hey baby
It was you who made me love you
Hey baby
Darling
It was you
It was you darlingSometimes in the morning when shadows are deep
I lie here beside you just watching you sleep
And sometimes I whisper what Im thinking of
My cup runneth over with love   
Sometimes in the evening when you do not see
I study the small things you do constantly
I memorize moments that Im fondest of
My cup runneth over with love   
In only a moment we both will be old
We wont even notice the world turning cold
And so in this moment with sunlight above
My cup runneth over with love   
With love   Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love and so is love
Your kiss don't mean what it used what it used to mean
It once was inspired now it's just another routine
I'm so afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love and so is love
I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clown's disguise
And then I'll learn to laugh laugh like Pagliacci oh with tears all in my eyes
Hey baby your kiss don't mean what it used what it used to mean
It once was inspired now it's just an everytime routine
I'm so afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love and so is love
 Oh


 You heard my feeling that it won't be yet
 Don't let me do that no more baby I can't do it
 I'd swear I can't do it baby

I've been loving you too long
I don't wanna stop now 
You're tired and you wanna be free 
But oh baby your love has become a habit to me
I've been loving and loving and loving and loving and loving you too long
And I ain't gonna stop now 
I don't wanna do it 
Baby with you my life
My life has been so wonderful I don't wanna stop now

You're tired and your love is growing cold
But my love is as this affair grows old
I've been loving and loving and loving you too long baby
You must be crazy if you think I'm gonna stop now
 I said I can't stop now
 I think I loved so good to you no more
 Until I think I need what you wantOn a Sunday afternoon 
Really couldn't get away too soon 
I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't no place I'd like to be instead of
Groovin'
Down a crowded avenue 
Doin' anything we like to do
There's always lots of things that we could see
We could be anyone we want to be
And all those happy people we could meet just
Groovin' 
On a Sunday afternoon 
Really baby I couldn't get away too soon 
We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
We're gonna talk and laugh our time away
I feel it comin' closer day by day
Life would be ecstasy you and me endlessly
Groovin' 
On a Sunday afternoon 
Oh really I couldn't get away too soon baby

'Cause darling you sent me
Groovin'Huh you know life is funny when you look at it
Everybody wants love
But everybody's afraid of love
You know I'm a true believer
If you get anything out of life
You got to put up with the toil and strife
Ooh You're pushin' my love
A little bit too far

You said if ever there was a time a time I needed you
You would come through
Yes if ever there was a time and time we needed you
You know that it's everyday every way

Lord I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done
And you say you know it really doesn't matter at all

'Cause Your word said I could
And I believe
You said if ever there was a time a time I needed you
You would come through
Yes if ever there was a time and time we needed you
Yes if ever there was a time and time we needed you
You know that it's everyday every way
Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
or the sound he appears to make
and he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
And nobody seems to like him
they can tell what he wants to do
and he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
Ooh ooh
Round and round and round
And he never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him
The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
Ooh
Round and round and roundI saw your face as I hurried past the cafe
And the rain felt like long lost tears
As it trickled down the window pane
And in a moment
All the years were simply washed away
'Cause when our eyes met when our eyes met
There was nothing left to say
I caught my breath I fell out of touch with time
'Cause it was you
With a part of me I'd forgotten that I ever knew
I stood to greet you and you held me
Just a little bit too long
Oh but we've come so far we've come so far
But the feeling's still so strong
If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost
Then it was yours and mine
If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was
That same perfume
Carries such a lot of memories of a time
When we dreamed sweet dreams
Never knowing they'd be left behind
Love is a memory like a picture
And it never seems to fade
Oh and I still believe and I still believe
All the promises we made
If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost
Then it was yours and mine
If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was
And I still believe I still believe
All the promises we made
If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost
Then it was yours and mine
If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was
It was yours and mine
That was the the timeIf you want my lovin'
If you really do
Don't be afraid baby
Just ask me
Ya know I'm gonna give it to you

Always throw out a sly comment
Like is your man faithful
What time does he get home
Don't worry I ain't gonna need your help
I'm gonna watch y'all go home by yourself
A lil' bit of my man's sweet love
Is a whole lot better than none
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But ya never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
Skip the drama use common sense
You don't have love if you don't have patience
He's out in the street but don't forget
My twice a week and that almighty paycheck
See I don't even sweat it
I get so much happiness
If I just put up with a lil' bit a bullsh**
A lil' bit of my man's sweet love is a whole lot better than none
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But ya never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
Think no evil when somebody comes home
Hear no evil I don't want to know
See no evil I just wanna see love
Because somebody always takes care of everybody's wants
Don't interrogate 'bout how he spends his spare time
Whatever he chooses to do is fine
'Cause in my heart I believe he's all mine
'Cause you think I can't see
Doesn't mean that I'm blind
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
Watch somebody running game
But ya never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Everybody's somebody's fool I'm a roadrunner honey

With a positive mind
Take self inventory of your woman and your glory
Leave the bad things behind 
Everybody's got a story 
About love and the good things
But for the spices of your life

Telling everybody out loud
How a girl becomes some proud

And I hope you'll be thinkin' of me too
Yes I must confess that I will miss you
Like the stars would miss the sky
Like a whale would miss its water
If it should ever happen to run dry
Although I cried when you left me
Yes I cried for a year and a day
You know my soul can't last my soul just can't last
Please answer me right awayFeels like I've seen you before
Maybe in a past life you were mine and I was yours
'Cause the vibe we share feels so comfortable
Is it possible someone could make me lose control
Look what you've done to me 
Finding it hard to breathe
'Cause I just can't believe
You're feeling me like I'm feeling you
I had to pinch myself 
'Cause nobody else has 
Given me such a chill
And made me feel the way that you do
I just gotta let you know
In case you didn't know
Iiiiii think you're wonderful
There's this thing you do to me
That thing that makes me weak
Baby iiii think you're wonderful
Questioning what this is
If it's too good to be true
I don't want to fool myself
'Cause I'm fallin' hard for you
Givin' me that old school love
Sayin' I'm the only one
Showin' me in so many ways
That you're crazy for me
Look what you've done to me 
Finding it hard to breathe
'Cause I just can't believe
You're feeling me like I'm feeling you
I had to pinch myself 
'Cause nobody else has
Given me such a chill
And make me feel the way that you do baby
I just gotta let you know
In case you didn't know
Iiiiii think you're wonderful
There's this thing you do to me
That thing that makes me weak
Baby iiii think you're wonderful

Far away from here
It would be okay
As long as you are there
You take away my pain
And I'll never be the same
You've got my heart baby
And I just want to say baby

Just having you
Breathlessly and Eager
Submission isn't easy for me

I always known it could be
Don't want to do nothing
Tied against your will
This ain't no cheap thrill
You got to know just how it feel
And if you think your going to fall
All you have to do is call
I have nothing in my self
And I give my self to you
Say child tingle sparkle
I hope the love never breaks away
Keep the fire burning everyday
Save all the warmth for you
Just want you to know
When your jealousy shows
Understand there will be no other man
But you baby
You can believe
This love in me
As I believe in youHello sunshine

So glad to see you sunshine
Hello sunshine

It's been dark for a very long time
I can't explain what I've been through

Trying to live my life without you
People say I act so strange

But you got the power to make me change
Hello sunshine

I'm so glad to see you sunshine
Hello sunshine

It's been dark for a very long time
Without you sunshine

The world is such a lonely place

And without you sunshine

My heart was filled with an empty space

Without you sunshine

The wind and the rain
The wonders of spring
Don't mean a thing
Without you baby
Without you baby
Without you baby
Without you baby

Now I know everything is alright

No more pain no more sleepless nights

My days were dark but now I see

Because my sunshine has come home to me
Without you sunshine

The world is such a lonely place

And without you sunshine

My heart was filled with an empty space

Without you sunshine

The wind and the rain

They don't mean a thing

The wonders of spring

Without you baby

Without you baby

Oh without you baby

Oh without you baby
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plain
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their sweet refrain
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord the newborn King
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
See Him in a manger laid
Whom the choirs of angels praise
Mary Joseph lend your aid
While our hearts in love we praise
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
In excelsis Deo
In excelsis Deo
Merry Christmas
From the Franklin's to all of youTwas the night before Christmas
When all through the house
Not a creature was stirring
Not even a mouse
The stockings all hung
By the chimney with care
In hopes that St Nicholas
Soon would be there
The children were nestled
All safe in their beds
While visions of sugarplums
Danced in their heads
And Mom in her kerchief
And I in my cap
Had just settled down
For a long winters nap
When out on the lawn
There arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed
To see what was the matter
Away to the window
I flew like a flash
Tore open the shutters
And threw up the sash
The moon on the breast
Of the new fallen snow
Gave the luster of midday
To object below
When what to my wandering eyes
Should appear
But a miniature sleigh
And eight tiny reindeer
With a little ol' driver
So lively and quick
I knew in a moment
It must be St Nick
More rapid than eagles
His courses they came
As he whistled and shouted
And called them by name
Now Dasher now Dancer
Now Prancer now Vixen
On Comet on Cupid
On Doner and Blitzen
To the top of the porch
To the top of the wall
Now dash away dash away
Dash away all
As dry leaves before the wild
Hurricane fly when they meet
With an obstacle
Mount to the sky
So up to the housetop
The courses they flew
With a sleigh full of toys
And St Nicholas too
And then in a twinkling
I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing
Of each little hoof
As I drew in my head
And was turning around
Down the chimney St Nicholas
Came with a bound
He was dressed all in fur
From his head to his foot
And his clothes
Were all tarnished
With ashes and soot
A bundle of toys
He had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler
Just opening his pack
His eyes how they twinkle
His dimples how merry
His cheeks were like roses
His nose like a cherry
His drawl little mouth
Was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin
Was a white as the snow
The stump of his pipe
He held tight in his teeth
And the smoke it
Encircled his head like a wreath
He had a broad face
And a round little belly
That shook when he laughed
Like a bowl full of jelly
He was chubby and plump
A right jolly old elf
I laughed when I saw him
In spite of myself
A wink of his eye
And a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know
I had nothing to dread
He spoke not a word
But went straight
To his work and filled
All the stockings
Then turned with a jerk
An laying a finger
Along side his nose
An giving a nod
Up the chimney he rose
He sprang to his sleigh
To his team gave a whistle
An away they all flew
Like the down of a thistle
But I heard him exclaim
As he drove out of sight
Happy Christmas to all
And to all a goodnight

These tears I cry won't let me rest
Till you return
There's not one day that goes by
That I don't cry for you

That I don't wish it could work
And it's tearing me up inside
Every little bit hurts

Is very slowly tearing me apart
What can I do to make you see

And don't you miss the way I used to love you
There's not one day that goes by
That I don't cry for you

Every little bit hurts
You used to kiss me
You used to hold me
You used to love me
You used to touch me
All night long you made everything alright
But now you're gone and I'm all alone
Things have stayed the same
And all I'm really tryin' to say I'm the one to blame
There's not one day that goes by
That I don't cry for you
There's not one day that goes by
That I'm not singing the blues
There's not one day that goes by
That I don't wish it could work
And it's tearing me up inside
Every little bit hurtsNow there was a time when they used to say
That behind every great man there had to be a great woman
Now in these times of change you know that it's no longer true
So we're comin' out of the kitchen
'Cause there's somethin' we forgot to say to you
We said Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Standin' on their own two feet
And ringin' on their own bells
We said Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Now this is a song to celebrate
The conscious liberation of the female state
Mothers daughters and their daughters too oh yeah

Everybody take a look around
Can you see can you see

We said Sisters are doin' it for themselves oh yes we are
Standin' on their own two feet
And ringin' on their own bells
Sisters are doin' it for themselves

Don't you know that a man still loves a woman
When a woman still loves a man
Just a same though
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
There was a time when they used to say
That behind every great man there had to be a great woman
In these times of change you know that it's no longer true
So we're comin' out of the kitchen
'Cause there's somethin' we forgot to say to you

Without the one you love
New Year's just ain't New Year's
Without the one you love
Underneath the mistletoe
I saw his face all aglow
Last year this time
Now I'm staying home alone
And this house ain't a home
Without that man of mine
Christmas just ain't Christmas
Without the one you love
New Year just ain't New Year's
Without the one you love
Twelve o'clock and all is well
And I was doing oh so swell
Last year this time
Goin' shopping for presents together
Vowing to leave each other never
It was a waste of time
Christmas just ain't Christmas
Without the one you love
New Year just ain't New Year's
Without the one you love
Christmas just ain't Christmas
Without the one you love
New Year just ain't New Year's
Without the one you love
Christmas just ain't Christmas
Without the one you love
New Year's just ain't New Year's
Without the one you loveJoy joy
Joy to the world the Lord has come
Let earth receive her king
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing and heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing
Joy to the world the Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousness
And wonders of his love and wonders of his love
And wonders wonders of his love wonders
Joy to you and me joy to people joy to you and me
And wonders wonders of his loveThere was a time when men were kind
When their voices were soft
And their words inviting
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
Then it all went wrong
I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung no wine untasted
But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
And they turn your dream to shame
He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came
And still I dream he'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather
I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamedAll this time
I couldn't shake your memory
And I never knew the
Sweetest love was the first
So what am I supposed
To do about this curse
Oh baby I've got you to blame
And I'm calling
Calling out your name
Oh he was so fine
Jimmy Lee oh he was so fine
Jimmy Jimmy Lee

Jimmy Jimmy Lee

Find me rushing off
To school every morning
Never had a care
Acting crazy always laughing
When I'm running
Cause I knew you'd meet me
When I got there
Stealing kisses in the hall
Before the first bell
You smelled so fine
Though we'd just met
I guess you knew me so well
You had the number to my heartline

Well just between you and me

He was the first one

He stole my heart
And he ran like a bandit
I don't understand it
Jimmy Lee this one's for me
And I'll always remember
History biology
And that magical December
Ooh boy
Jimmy Lee where can you be
If this song ever finds you
Won't you please explain to me
Why you left me behind you yeah
 Jimmy
On the average twice a week
I think I see you
On some avenue
Someone laughs or shakes his head
They way you used to
I guess I got myself a loose screw
I grew up and
Had my share of adventure
Well I've had some fun
But you never need
To question my intentions
Cause each guy is just another rerun

Well just between you and me

He was the first one

He stole my heart
And he ran like a bandit
I don't understand it
Jimmy Lee this one's for me
And I'll always remember

Leaving here on a Southbound train
And let me tell you that nothing is ever going to bring your sweet sweet baby back again
Nobody knows nobody knows nobody knows the way I feel this morning morningWoke up this mornin' to a perfect day
I opened my window heard a sparrow say
Positive thoughts are runnin' through my mind
Nothin' is wrong feelin' real strong
'Cause a new day is comin'
The sun is shining
The sun is shining
The sun is shining
The sun is shining
The sun is shining no clouds in view
Lovers are holdin' hands the world's brand new
Everybody's smiling summer's comin' through
But the only thing that's missing is you
Baby baby show me what do you do when love is gone
You count your blessings and you move on
No I ain't lonely this ain't no sad song
There's just one contradiction I can't stand to be alone
The sun is shining
The sun is shining
The sun is shining
The sun is shining
The sun is shining no clouds in view
Lovers are holdin' hands the world's brand new
Everybody's smiling summer's comin' through
But the only thing that's missing is you
I see your smile through your photograph
The thing that you said still makes me laugh
Deep inside I'm on the edge of tears
But I can't be cryin' sittin' around sighin'
Just 'cause you're not here
The sun is shining no clouds in view
Lovers are holdin' hands the world's brand new
Everybody's smiling summer's comin' through
But the only thing that's missing
The only thing that's missing
The sun is shining no clouds in view
Lovers are holdin' hands the world's brand new
Everybody's smiling summer's comin' through
But the only thing that's missing is you
Only thing that's missin' is youI can't cover up my feelings
In the name of love
Or play it safe
For a while that was easy
And if living for myself
Is what I'm guilty of
Go on and sentence me
I'll still be free
It's my turn
To see what I can see
I hope you'll understand
This time's just for me
Because it's my turn
With no apologies
I've given up the truth
To those I've tried to please
But now it's my turn
If I don't have all the answers
At least I know I'll take my share of chances
Ain't no use of holding of
When nothing stays the same
So I'll let it rain
'Cause the rain ain't gonna hurt me
And I'll let you go
'Though I know it won't be easy
It's my turn
With no more room for lies
For years I'd seen my life
Through someone else's eyes
And now it's my turn
To try and find my way
And if I should get lost
At least I'll own today
It's my turn
Yes it's my turn
And there ain't no use in holding of
When nothing stays the same
So I'll let it rain
'Cause the rain ain't gonna hurt me
And I'll let you go
'Though I know it won't be easy
It's my turn
To see what I can see
I hope you'll understand
This time's just for me
Because it's my turn
To turn and say goodbye
I sure would like to know
That you're still on my side
Because it's my turn
It's my turn
It's my turn
To start from number one
Trying to undo
Some damage that's been done
But now it's my turn
To reach and touch the sky
No one's gonna say
At least I didn't try
It's my turn
Yes it's my turn
It's my turn
It's my turn
It's my turnSet me free why don't you babe
Get out of my life why don't you babe
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hanging' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hanging' on
Why do you keep a coming around
Playing with my heart
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me make a new start
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me
Set me free why don't you babe
Let me be why don't you babe
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hanging' on
Now you don't really want me
You just keep me hanging' on
You say although we broke up
You still want to be just friends
But how can we still be friends
When seeing you only breaks my heart again
And there ain't nothing I can do about it
Woo set me free why don't you babe
Woo get out my life why don't you babe
Set me free why don't you babe
Get out my life why don't you babe
You claim you still care for me
But your heart and soul needs to be free
Now that you've got your freedom
You want to still hold on to me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else Hey
Why don't you be a man about it
And set me free
Now you don't care a thing about me
You're just using me
Go on get out get out of my life
And let me sleep at night
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hanging' onI just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's going to be alright
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you you you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's going to be alright
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you you you
Can get in the way of what I feel
I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try try to divide something so real
So till the end of time I'm telling you there ain't no one
No one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh baby my love
It's always been you
You make me so damn happy
I thought I knew who you were
Oh but after twice around
I can say exactly
Of course this is love
And I never say
I didn't care about you
You sweet thing
But you can't pretend
The serious burn
That I feel in my heart and there it's
A wedding ring oh
I got to get over you
Its so hard
Youre my everything
Baby when I think of us when
It's in the tea leaves
That we won't get our turn
You can't always have
What you want
You have to take the bitter
With the sweet
I'm a big girl
And I know what I want
Three nights in your arms would be
A super treat
Got to tell me baby
Got to get over you
But it's so hard
Because you're my every everything
When I think about us when
I know it's in the tea leaves
And we won't get our turn
Oh baby
Oh baby
Hey boy
So damn happy
Babe it's always been you
Oh baby
I'm so happy with my baby
Hey boy I'm so damn happy
Yes always with you
Hey boy I'm so damn happy
I remember the moment
Yeah baby
Yeah boy
Forget about it
It's always been youThis is my life and it's my right to live
The way I want to live each day
That's what I wanna say
And this is my song
And for too long I sang someone else's melody
It wasn't really me
Somehow I took myself for granted
In someone else's eyes
I saw reflections of a girl I was who caught me by surprise
Seein' a woman who's defined by you I never realized
I can't love you I can't love me through someone else's eyes
You were the sun I was the one who just
Revolved around you day and night
You were my only life but if I were free
Baby I'd take control of everything inside of me
Find who I wanna be
I'd never take myself for granted
In someone else's eyes
I saw reflections of a girl I was who caught me by surprise
Seein' a woman who's defined by you I never realized
I can't love you I can't love me in someone else's eyes
I gotta show myself I can still exist without a man
Gotta finally take control gotta see myself as whole with you
Though you're not the one to blame I was lost inside your name
And I'll never be the same till I find a way back home again
In someone else's eyes
I saw reflections of a girl I was who caught me by surprise
Seein' a woman who's defined by you I never realized
When I I can't I and I will not you can't make me
Ooh someone else's eyes ooh baby baby baby
Till I find a way back home again
Through someone else's eyes
I saw reflections of a girl I was hey caught me by surprise
Seein' a woman who's defined by you I never realized
I can't love you I can't love you through someone else's eyes ooh
Someone else's eyes no baby ooh
Someone else's eyes can't do it I can't do it
I I love you sweet baby I wanna be with you baby
Through someones else's eyes ooh
Someone else's eyes oh baby
Oh yeah someone else's eyes
I wanna be by your side
God haven't you heard this lady's cryIt's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing can take away the blues
Nothing compares nothing compares to you
So lonely here without you
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong
And I could put my arms around every boy that I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me he told me
He said Aretha girl you better have fun
Nothing compares nothing compares to you
All the flowers that you send me
They all died when you went away
I know it's hard living with me
But I'm willing to try willing to try willing to try yeah
Nothing compares nothing compares to you
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares nothing compares to you
Nothing nothing nothing nothing compares to you
Nothing nothing compares to you boy
Nothing nothing nothing compares to you
No one compares yeah yeah
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares to you
I love my darling cause cause nothing nothing compares to youLA proved too much for the man

With Luther hoping that you feeling his groove
Get you open on the instruments too one two one two
And I say jottin' down the lines
Like dots on the Parkway
My Auntie Eloise say stay on your Q's and P's
And until the days of D's I'm doin' what I please
Ease on down like the road
Depending on the mood definitely into more
And you can catch a yellow brick
You need to run and tell your click
That the female in town is bringing it
Now listen Mission Impossible

Shake rattle and roll to rock wit' chu
The Pre to the CISE do

And I know just how to do it
To make it really nice

Luther and PreciseI was born in a crossfire hurricane well
And I howled at my ma at the driving rain ooh yeah
But it's alright oh that is a gas
I said it's all right
Jumpin' Jack Flash is a gggas oh yeah
I was raised by a toothless bearded hag yeah
I was schooled with a strap right across my back oh yes I was
But it's alright and that is a gas
I said it's all right
Jumpin' Jack Flash is a gggas
I was drowned washed up and left for dead yes sure was
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled ooh
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread yes I did
I was crowned with a spike right in through my head oh yeah
But it's all it's alright oh and that is a gas
I said it's all alright
Jumpin' Jack Flash is a gas yes it is
Jumpin' Jack Flash it's a gas

Jumpin' Jack Flash it's a gas

Jumpin' Jack Flash it's a gas

HallelujahI tried so hard my dear to show
That you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do
Is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past
Keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold cold heart
Another love before my time
Made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now
For things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said
That make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold cold heart
You'll never know how much it hurts
To see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love
Yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies
To try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold cold heart
There was a time when I believed
That you belonged to me
But now I know your heart
Is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you
The more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold cold heartIt's an ever changing time
I see that clock upon the wall
Well it don't bother me at all
It's an ever changing time
And me ever changing time
Everything is going so much faster
It seems like I'm
Watching my life and everything I do
Wonder if the dreams that I believed in
Still come true
Caught in between it comes back to
You and me running out of time I gotta find me a better understanding
Everything keeps forgetting whats mine I gotta find me a way lessdemanding
And we're holding on so tight together all of our lives
And I I had some big idea
So much of my life still not completed
Hopes and Fears
Watching it change into something new
Wondering it I'm gonna find the answer loving you
All of my life it comes back to
You and me running out of time I gotta find me a better understanding
Everything keeps forgetting whats mine I gotta find me a way lessdemanding
And we're holding on so tight together all of our lives

I see that clock upon the wall well it don't bother me at all
It's a ever changing time
All of my life it comes back to
You and me running out of time I gotta find me a better understanding
Everything keeps forgetting whats mine I gotta find me a way lessdemanding
And we're holding on so tight together
And we're gonna be alright together all of our lives

I see that clock upon the wall well it don't bother me at all
It's a ever changing timeUh

Lead me to Soulville baby
Oh that's where I belong
Come on and lead me
Right on down to Soulville
Right on down to Soulville
Take me honey
Right on down to Soulville
I gotta make a phone call
Right on down to Soulville
Oh lead me right on down
Lead me right on down
Talking 'bout the candied sweets
Down in Soulville
I'm talking 'bout the black eyed peas
Down in Soulville oh yeah
Yes Sir down in SoulvilleI was never spellbound by a starry sky
What is there to moon glow when love has passed you by
Then there came a midnight and the world was new
Now here am I so spellbound darling
Not by stars but just by you
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At Last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in HeavenThere's a fire burning in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out of the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I will leave with every part of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire burning in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
It keeps me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they keep me breathless I can't help thinking
We could have had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
But you played it to the beat 
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn woah
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there 'cause mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love remind me of us
It keeps me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love keep me breathless I can't help thinking
We could have had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
But you played it to the beat 
We could have had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
But you played it to the beat 
To the beat beat beat beat
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow
You know that there ain't no mountain high enough 
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you 
You know that there ain't no mountain high enough 
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe 
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it to the beat 
We could have had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
I'm still in love with you yes I am 
Oh yeah oh yeah 
Oh come on yeah Oh how it hurts like child birth
The wounds heal slow you just don't know
At times I don't know what to say
And all I do is pray day to day
But still I feel my strength might die
Like right now I'm tryin' hard not to cry
Even when I close my eyes I still see it
Damn I just don't believe it
The bad times I buried like the cemetery
Unworthy people playin' beneficiaries
A lotta people eatin' off of one man's death
Don't you worry BI I'ma ride to my last breath
You killas caused a lotta devastation
You have no idea what you did to this nation
I fuckin' hate you excuse my frustration
But just when I'm about to quit God tells me to just
Don't you give up be strong
Hold on hold on
Things are gonna get better
Tough times they last so long
Hold on hold on
If you believe they will get better
Frank White the man with the money and the fame
Passed away now bitches wanna claim his name
I been with my nigga before he came in the game
No one's no V's we used to take the train
Just us and the Mafia goin' out to parties
I guess back then we was real nobodies
But he was my nigga and I was his bitch
I rolled hard with him how could I forget him
Had beef with yo wife that ain't patched up
But still got love for your kids
Even wrote 'em in my will
And I'ma make sure the fam keep a decent meal
No matter what I got to do or who I got to kill
Shit is real baby there ain't no appeal
If I'm fucked up imagine how Mrs Wallace feels
Sometimes I sit and think how it would be if we was married
Of if I woulda kept the child that I carried
So to my ladies don't think I haven't walked in yo shoes
Or thought this was only happenin' to you righ'
Here's my shoulder you can lean on this boo
Cuz trust me I know exactly what you're going through
Don't you give up be strong
Hold on hold on
Things are gonna get better
Tough times they last so long
Hold on hold on
If you believe they will get better
So I guess you know the story of how it all ends
Depressed stressed don't know who's my real friends
One thing's for sure I can count on my mens
DRoc Money L Lil' Cease and PD
My whole BI family remind me of you
We miss you so much I love you so much
Never thought life without you would be so rough
But I know we gon make it
We ain't happy but we fakin'
And to New York thanks for the support
And all our real fans I'm shoutin' out the whole land
This is somethin' young kids just won't understand
How they took away this beautiful man
Who shared so many memories
I could go on and on but a song can only be so long
It's been hard but I told God that I put up a fight
So here's a Long Kiss Goodnight Frank White
Don't you give up be strong
Hold on hold on
Things are gonna get better
Tough times they last so long
Hold on hold on

I'm a teen tiny girl a little lady
I live under the kitchen floor
Right here not so far from you
Sometimes I feel happy
Sometimes I feel blue
In my dreams O I wish I could
Feel my hair blowing in the wind
See the sky and the summer rain
Pick a flower from the garden for you
Beyond the lane there's another world
Butterflies floating in the air
But is there someone out there for me
And so life goes on day after day
With knickknacks on the floor nooks and crannies
I live in a tiny world
But out there someone waits for me
I wish I had someone to watch over me
In my dreams O I wish I could
Feel my hair blowing in the wind
See the sky and the summer rain
Pick a flower from the garden for you
Now I know there's another world
Butterflies floating in the air
There is someone out there for meThe sickness took her away It attacked the whole city Such damage has it done Researchers search for a cure It's too late for her She's already gone Such damage has it done The sirens echo Get set ready and go They're racing to save you The streetlights flicker She only gets sicker There's nothing we can do but they're racing to save you We try to act like there's nothing wrong here Oh our people our cities they're all just fine Everything's alright Everything is fine The sickness took her away It attacked the whole city Such damage has it doneDance dance Break out of that stance You're stuck in this place where you'll waste away Wake up Get up now make a move Don't do what they tell you to Go I thought we were going to meet tonight I thought we'd grab a bite to eat But you were no where in site I guess you were lost into the night I strained my eyes just looking for your face The eyes all looked the same If you'd just open up your eyes We could try this again sometime Go And we can dance along the sidewalks and see the faces of the walking dead stare at us with their shocking pride Maybe we'll start a brand new trend Everyone dance Dance hard Here we goForce your culture on me and force me into your schools Force me into your church and make me a government tool This is nothing new for you You do this every time You find a new ethnic group and commit the same old crime You leave us with Broken cultures broken beliefs broken treaties and broken dreams broken homes broken schools we'll break your system and break your rules So now you finally see that we are all the same We are all human but your actions are not humane So now you realize that we must unite No matter what your race we are all the same We'll fix these Broken cultures broken beliefs broken treaties and broken dreams broken homes broken schools we'll break your system and break your rules We'll break your We'll break your fucking rulesthe words that come right out of your mouth

don't tell me that I don't love my country
when all I really want is peace
but if a patriot is someone who'll fight for you then no I'm no patriotno

raise your fist we must resist
raise your fist don't enlist
woah

Imagine there's no heaven It's easy if you try No hell below us and above us only sky Imagine all the people living for today Imagine there's no countries It isn't hard to do Nothing to kill or die for and no religion too Imagine all the people living life in peace You may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one I hope someday you join us and the world can live as one Imagine no possessions Its easy if you try No need for greed or hunger A brotherhood of man Imagine all the people sharing all the world You may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one I hope someday you join us and the world can be as oneIm standing high above
Im talking to the sky
And Im dancing in distortion
I filled my life with all thats right
Thanks for leaving the door wide open
I know its not over
Im only getting closer to feel alive
Every step that I take
Brings me back to yesterday
We would drive away
Walking through my past
Everything has faded grey
In shadows long ago
Life was always make or break
Do I give or do I take
I see that I know
I know its not over
Im only getting closer to feel alive
Every step that I take
Brings me back to yesterday
We would drive away
I want to be 
More than anything 
Far from this place
Take me away
From here
This cant be my exit I know where I stand
This cant be my exit I know who I am
Remember the days we drove away
Remember laughing in the rain
I believe in what I see and what I see is you
I know its not over
Im only getting closer to feel alive
Every step that I take
Brings me back to yesterday
We would drive awaySo move like you never did 
Show me what you got 
Chuck me right off the grid
That look in your eyes got me wanting more
But Ive got the beat and Ill meet you on the floor
Jump jump and bring the floor down dont stop
Hands up and shout it out now jump jump
Lets sing the night away I want to see you smile
Lets bring the floor down in style
Wow you really make me tick
And Im off the wall
Im so ready to explode
Count me down
Jump jump and bring the floor down dont stop
Hands up and shout it out now jump jump
Lets sing the night away I want to see you smile
Lets bring the floor down in styleI wake up early in the morning to the sounds I hear outside
Such a noise Im going crazy I got to get out and find
What Ive always wanted in my whole life
Its up to me and I wont let fate decide
Luck only takes you far enough but not this time
Luck only makes you feel like La La La
Luck only takes you luck only makes you
And I got nothing left to lose
Before it breaks you down
And to all the friends that got lost in the biz
May this song give you strength to find a way back
Through the mist of the fame oh what a taste
Of another dream gone to waste
Luck only takes you far enough but not this time
Luck only makes you feel like La La La
Luck only takes you luck only makes you
And I got nothing left to lose
Before it breaks you down
Listen closely to the sounds you hear outside
Its time to get up you got to get out
And make something of your life
Luck only takes you far enough but not this time
Luck only makes you feel like La La La
Luck only takes you luck only makes you
And I got nothing left to lose
Before it breaks you downSlow down figure out
Whats the story all about
Do we stand or do we run
Weve only just begun
To see this life unfold in a different view
Its been so long without skies of blue
We scream this is just a dream or so it seems
I am not awake I am not
I am lost in the dark
Searching for a golden spark

Finally we all break free and find ourselves completely
And now I see what I can be knowing I am ready
Ready or not here I come
Breaking walls down with a spark of a gun
Fuck you you always got me wrong
You always got me wrong
You always got meIf it leads to something then Im fine with it
If it leads to nothing then oh fuck it
I gave up my misery
I gave it all away
I brought back the melody just to say
When you decide to say goodbye
Leave it up to me my July
When you decide to say goodbye
Leave it up to me my July
When you decide to say goodbye
Leave it up to me to ignite you city light my July
And everything is a memory of how we used to be
And life has no guarantees so we will see
I know its not easy letting all this go
But for all I know this will make you grow
When you decide to say goodbye
Leave it up to me to ignite your city light
When you decide to say goodbye
Leave it up to me to ignite your city light my July
BURN
When you decide to say goodbye
Leave it up to me my July
When you decide to say goodbye
Leave it up to me my July
When you decide to say goodbye
Leave it up to me to ignite your city light
When you decide to say goodbye
Leave it up to me to ignite your city light my JulyYou tell me that you're praying for me
You tell me I'm blind that I can't see
You tell me I'm bound and I need to be set free
But it's hard to believe 'cos you're just like me
You tell me I have a drugalcohol addiction
Yet you offer no way out no solution
You tell me if I don't change my ways I'll be condemned to hell
Well maybe you're right but oh well
It's so easy to show me what I'm doing wrong
It's so easy to point out all my sins
But what about you aren't you supposed to show me love
Isn't that how you Christians are supposed to live
You tell me I need to follow Jesus and change my ways
But why would I want to be like you you always seem so ashamed
You tell me I need to get saved from this fiery pit
But who wants to serve the God of a hypocrite
Until you start to practice what you preach don't ever expect me to change the way I liveWhy can't I be on MTV
Why can't I be on MTV
Why can't I be on MTV
'Cause they just don't like me
Why can't I be on MTV
Why can't I be on MTV
Why can't I be on MTV
'Cause I'm trying to help you see
Corporate capitalistic pigs all your ads are fake
You're lying to the sheep out there but I won't take the bait
You use Pepsi and Nike oh and VH1
Calvin Klein and Tommy Jeans make it look so fun
By using all of the popular bands
They're selling out for more money
When will all of this end
Let's exploit sex and more through our videos
Why can't we be on MTV
Why can't we be on MTV
Why can't we be on MTV
'Cause we won't lose integrity
What you like is popular 'cause you have all the dough
You turn the kids to zombies they don't care 'cause they don't know
You feed us lies and greed and garbage on the radio
There's better music out there but you don't want us to know
Advertise through mainstream movies
Show off your logo by sticking in to some
Dumb popsuperstar that everybody knows
Totalitary America that's just how it goes
Why can't we be a part of your game
Why can't we have your fortune and fame
Why can't we all just be the same
'Cause we're not clones and we can't think for ourselves
Why can't we be a part of your game
Why can't we have your fortune and fame
Why can't we all just be the same
'Cause we're not clones and we can't think for ourselves
One two three four one two three four
One two three four one two threeCruise the strip gotta look real cool
Turn up the bass act like a fool
Bad rap on the stereo
Act so tough put on a show
Daddy bought you a brand new car
Down the road you go so far
Don't you got better things to do
You probably do but you'll never know
Whoaohh
You're only sixteen but you know it all
And I'm so sick of all you sheep
You're stuck in your own world so deep
So follow what the crowd's doing
Your weekend quest for popularity
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh go
American brat you got it all
You're so proud but you're gonna fall
Disrespect all authority
It's your strip do as you please
Trespass on the property
Be real loud disturb the peace
Drink have sex spread your disease
You call it rebellion I call it conformity
But you gotta be what you gotta be
And I'm so sickyou see me with your eyes
I wear a good disguise
but somehow you still think you know me
my life is empty now
my heart is blackened out
but I gotta fit in
I also gotta be honest with myself before I kill somebody else
the world has done a number on me
compassion is devoid
I'm always so annoyed
my selfishness it now concedes me
but that's ok 'cause no one seems to recognize me anyway
I'm mistaken for someone else constantly througout my day
I won't get caught 'cause no one knows that I'm an american psycho
I know what brand you wear
I know what kind of pair of pants and shoes and shirts you have on
I dine expensively with a hard body next to me
but she likely won't see your next thought
but that's ok 'cause no one seems to recognize me anyway
I'm mistaken for someone else constantly througout my day
I won't get caught 'cause no one knows that I'm an american psycho
that I'm an american psycho
it's so sad we only seem to care
about our face and hair
and what makes us look good
your business card is better
you have a bigger room
that could lead to your doom
and I really think it should
did you make it to the top of the world just to die
I own all the name brands
I have a nicer tan
I excersize and work out daily
I rent some videos
watch the patty winter show
my mind it thinks irrationally
but that's ok 'cause no one seems to recognize me anyway
I'm mistaken for someone else constantly througout my day
I won't get caught 'cause no one cares that I'm an american psycho
that I'm an american psycho that I'm an american psycho
it's so sad we only seem to care
about our face and hair
and what makes us look good
your business card is better
you have a bigger room
that could lead to your doom
and I really think it should
it's so sad we only seem to care
about our face and hair
and what makes us look good
your business card is better
you have a bigger room
that could lead to your doom
and I really think it should
did you make it to the top of the world just to die
oh did you make it to the top of the world just to die
you're gonna die Life's been getting harder every day
I don't know what to do or what to say
Nothing seems quite right I think I lost my fight
Do you think I'll live to see another day
You know I hate the job that I've been working at
But life just seems to go like that
Out here on my own well I feel so alone
Father won't you let me come home
Could you help me father could you help me out
Could you show me what to do or what to say
If you can't I understand cos I know you're just a man
You're my father so that's OK
I still don't know what I want to be
The world around me seems so crazy
Criminals in power the streets no longer safe
What kind of man would I want to be
There's a girl I love and you know I want to marry
She's everything I hoped she would be
So poppa if you would give some tips to help me out
So I'll know how to raise a family
Now I know you're not the wisest man to ever walk the earth
But I know Someone who just might be
So I'll stop stressing you with all the questions that I have
I'll go to the One who gave you meNow love is one thing and sex is another
But they got together like bread and butter
People think they know it all but they are confused
That's why so many people get hurt and used
Now I'm waiting for you and you're waiting for me
So believe it or not I think we're meant to be
We've been through the smiles and we've been through the tears
We've been though hell and heaven in the last four years
Let me tell you something 'cos I think you're ready
I'm your boy and you're my honey
So open your ears and close your eyes
And baby get ready for a big surprise
Hey you're the one who makes me happy
You're the one I want to marry
You're the one I want to be with oh oh oh
So please don't tell me no I don't want you to go
You're the one I want to wake up with
Now when I first say You my eyes were glued
Forgive me darlin' I don't mean to be rude
But you were the cutest mama I ever did see
So many guys agree I guarantee
But if you hurt me again I don't know what I'll do
I don't want to be alone I want to be with you
So many times you confuse me and I don't know what to do
But then again I'm a guy and I don't have a clue
Now love can be a very complicated thing
So don't confuse it with lust because it ain't the same
I know I love you from the bottom of my heart
You're God's creation you're a work of art
Now I feel sorry for those who don't know how to love
It's a wonderful thing it's a gift from above
Now baby I love you and I hope you can see
It's about time you married methe world is evil we're all goin to hell
my glass is half empty I don't feel so well
a pessimist from the very start
negative emotions fill my heart
but when I see your pretty face
it's hard to hate the human race
just whisper softly in my ear
I love you more with each passing year
I wanna go to mexico
when I think about you

I remember the good times that we've had
when I think about you

sometimes I wonder when the world is like a monster
it swollows me up and it makes me do things I don't wanna do

I cuss and I scream and the only thing that can calm me down is you

let's go Hollywood's been trying to make new friends with the aliens
By sending them our culture and our ways of life and all of our trends
Transmitting music and TV shows and all the cool clothes
Hoping for approval from the aliens but nobody knows
Oh they're sick of our movies
OhThey're sick of our lies

You're the sheep of the US of a
Well the youth can't think for themselves
For the trendious bands in America
Are telling you what to do
And if you had a mind that was your own
I hope you'd use it too
Well the media lies to us every day
You're being told what to hear
Hate and greed and adultery
Fight against them if you dare
But nobody will stand up
If you do then you're a jerk
'Cos MTV's the culture
Does fighting even work
Go follow the flock your poseurs
'Cos you're just like everyone else
You're the sheep of the US of a
Well the youth can't think for themselves
For your favorite band is singing trash
You say that you don't care
'Cos the media says they're in this year
So that's what you want to hear
For you think that you're rebelling
And you got things figured through
For you got to fit the image
That Hollywood gave to you
So follow the flock your poseurs
'Cos you're just like everyone else
You're the sheep of the US of a
Well the youth can't think for themselves
In a country full of zombies
Who is gonna steer
When the majority is dependent
On TV drugs and beer
Go follow the flock your poseurs
'Cos you're just like everyone else
You're the sheep of the US of a
Well the youth can't think for themselves
Follow the flock your poseurs

All of your lies and I'll be deceived
And I don't like the lies youre trying to make me believe
You call me a loser

All of your lies and I'll be deceived

I know that I am a child of the great I Am

to hell with younever mind the talent
forget about the skill
'cause we got something you never will
we're on a secret mission
so get out of our way
were not here to go corporate no
we just wanna play
were gonna get in your head
were gonna make you cry
were gonna give you nightmares
and i'll tell you why
were crushing crushing goHere in America I'm proud to say
That everyone's free and everything's OK
Do what you feel 'cause it's all good
Live how you want and not how you should
This is America land of opportunity
We kill our babies and we worship nudity
Our government's corrupted sin is accepted
Forget about Jesus 'cause he is rejected
Make your own god worship yourself
Put the Bible on the shelf
Here in America we do what we want
We're a Christian nation believe it or not
Now it ain't alright and it ain't all good
Let me tell you something you've misunderstood
The red white and blue just ain't in my blood
Maybe it's because of what this country's done
Now if we were founded on In God We Trust
We gave it up for sinful lust
Now there will come a day when we're gonna pay
So America turn back the other way
I am an American and the country in which I live
Is a country of hope and happiness and freedom it will give
But I don't see it that way because this holy blessed land
Has turned its back on the great I Am and jumped from His holy handAm I bein untrue
when i blame it on you
afterall I'm the one who let you go in 
I'm sorry to say
that I gave you away
to somebody else I fear I'll never see you again 
I should of stopped you
instead of turning away
losing your love
is a regret to this day
if I loved you at all
I could find words to say
but I didn't
so now it's too late
I should have said
don't go into the woods
don't let go of my hand
I should have said
don't go into the woods
do you understand me
woah
Am I bein untrue
when i blame it on you
afterall I'm the one who let you go in it's all my fault now
that I gave you away
to somebody else I fear I'll never see you again because of my own sin
is it because
you finished it second place
but that's not true baby
don't you know that you won that race
I guess I should've informed you
'cause I miss your sweet face
and now your gone
and now your gone without a trace
I should have said
don't go in to unknow places
young girls vanish without traces
I could not let that happen to you
woah
but if you leave me oh just maybe
strangers in the dark are waiting
when you're gone there's nothing I can do
there's animals in that woods
and there's shadows in that woods
oh baby there's manaics in that woods
but you're taking your chances
ain't no second glances
but you're taking your chances
Nooo
don't go in to unknow places
young girls vanish without traces
I could not let that happen to you
woah
but if you leave me oh just maybe
strangers in the dark are waiting
when you're gone there's nothing I can do
NOO
don't go into the woods
don't go into the woodsI parked the car I went inside
I left you there I don't know why
But I wish I'd taken you in with me
I was hanging out with my pals
I swear I didn't hear you shout
But if I did I'd have been there
And you'd still be here with me
Wake up from this dream
I'm so upset that I could scream
How could this happen to me
Who could've done such a thing
An evil deed that was in vain
Why did they take you from me
And I was going home that night
When I received a fright
I saw that you were gone oh I could cry
Where are you now
I wonder who is your new owner
I still like to sing these songs you used to play
I wish you'd come back to me
Make it how it used to be
But that will never happen
So now someone has to pay
Curse the ones that took you
Curse their evil ways
Curse the ones they love
Curse them all their days
If I find out how they are
I'm going to make it right
They're gonna give you back
Or there's gonna be a fight
All the selfish people in the world today
We'll be held responsible
We're gonna pay
You can't fall asleep
'Cos in your lives we'll creep
And then we'll take it all awayGod hates divorce
What about abuse
When 2 people just don't get along
Are they unfaithful
Why do what's right
when it's so much easier for man to do what's wrong
Your infants will suffer
oh
It's a full moon night
I'm gonna get a bite
I can't wait till i start transforming
Better hide your kids
Ya'll better wise up
Ya might as well just top breeding
Because the only way to stop this infestation
Of this selfish race and it's dehumanization
It's by decimation of all reproduction
So here is my own resolution
I WILL EAT YOUR CHILDREN hey
Yeshua taught respect
Filled with compassion
They claim that's their doctrine
But they don't live that way
The world revolves around those who only love themselves
It's been said but is it true that every
dog has his day
The innocent will suffer
oh
It's a full moon night
I'm gonna get a bite
I can't wait till i start transforming
Better hide your kids
Ya'll better wise up
Ya might as well just top breeding
Because the only way to stop this infestation
Of this selfish race and it's dehumanization
It's by decimation of all reproduction
So here is my own resolution
I WILL EAT YOUR CHILDREN heyI had a Grandma who was insane
and oh she had the sweetness of a striped candy cane 
and my old grandma she owned a gun 
and one day she said to me
sonny i want to have some fun
i said oh dear grandma whatcha talkin about
she looked at me with crazy eyes and then she started to shout
you've always been my favorite
i'll always love you the most
because you brownies and cookies and cakes
make no mistake about that grandma they're so good
but i think its time for you to die 'cause i wanna see your ghost
but i think its time for you to die 'cause i wanna see your ghost
but i think its time for you to die 'cause i wanna see your ghost
but i think its time for you to die 'cause i wanna see your ghostI got my figures on the wall
Comics stacked up in the hall
I got a movie in my DVD player
I got my music that I love
And a girl sent from above
I got my problems
But they seem to little next to her
Man oh man I got no money
Spent it all on my new honey
I got you and you got me
And that's all that we need
No one seems to understand me
Later still dont ever leave
I'm feelin sad you're all I have
So baby hear my plea
And even though I can't converse with you
There are so many other things that we can do
As you lay there lifeless on my bed
You're never really livin' so you can't be dead
You'll never die so tears won't be shed
So you think that I'm so cool
Not like I was bad in school
I didn't have a friend
And everyone was mean
Introverted and I know it
And i'm not afraid to show it
Cause there's no one here like me
It's my scene
Man oh man I can't relate to others
And it feels so great
I don't need people
Don't need friends
I only want my toys
Loving you it must be sin
I'm talkin to myself again
But that's ok cause momma said I'm not like other boys
And even though I can't converse with you
There are so many other things that we can do
As you lay there lifeless on my bed
You're never really livin so you can't be dead
You'll never die so tears won't be shed
Olivia you're not a real female
But you work with me even when relationships fail
Olivia your skin it feels so real
On the internet is where I got this great deal
And even though I can't converse with you
There are so many other things that we can do
As you lay there lifeless on my bed
You're never really livin' so you can't be dead
You're never really livin' so you can't be dead
You'll never die so tears won't be shedI'll talk to you tomorrow
I'll show you love another time
I'll be your friend tomorrow
Even though you'll die tonight
So many people so many hurts
But you're the one who stands out
I see your sorrow and it makes me cry
You need to know what love's about
The Maker saved me
He could save you too
I wish that I could know you
There are better days
There is some hope
You could be happy and it's true
You don't have to be sorry
You don't have to put on a show
I'll tell you of His love but now I'm busy
So I guess you will never know
I'll talk to you tomorrowRemember when we used to get Chinese
Or would you please just hear me out
For a moment before I eat my tounge it all goes wrong
I know it wasn't your fault when your bowling ball smashed in my head
Cause accidents they happen and I'm still alive though I should be dead
I come to you tonight not to scare you or to give you fright
But to make sure that we're still an item and possible spend the night
Perhaps you sure you wern't sleeping in gives me a feeling deep within
I just come up from the ground if we fooled around would it be sin
But wait you know it almost seems that your not happy to see me
My love that's brought me back to you so please tell me that you've been true
It seems that I've been gone so long my dear my love for you is strong
Death can't keep me away from you in your hands my heart belongs
And I can see that you don't see the sparkle on my face
And I notice that you don't notice that my heart is still in place
So you're upset and you're crying and you're walking out the door
And I'm fine that you don't like me anymore
Now days have passed and so am I no matter how I try and try
I just can't seem to win you back maybe it's because lack of hair
It's been falling out I just can't get rid of this smell
No more hours of making out why couldn't I've just have gone to Hell
Sex used to be so good and so was hanging out
Now your obviously sickened by me and I'm starting to doubt your love is true
Even though I'm dead I missed you every day
But my skin is rotting off my body I'm starting to decay
And I can see that you don't see the sparkle on my face
And I notice that you notice that my heart is out of place
So you're upset and you're crying and you're walking out the door
And I'm fine that you don't like me anymore
I'm giving you just one more chance to change you mind and take this dance
I wanna be the dead loves slave that's why I've risen from the grave
So take me as I am but if you don't I understand
But know this hasen't been in vain cause
I COULD ALWAYS EAT YOUR BRAIN
I could always eat you brain
I could always eat you brain
I could always eat you brain
I could always eat you brain
I could always eat you brain
You could always eat my brain
I could always eat you brain
You could always eat my brain
I could always eat you brain
You could always eat my brain
I could always eat you brain
I was walking down the street one night
Looking for something to do
When up from the shadows came this horrific fright
And his name was Vincent Van Bow
And as he drew close I started to cry
And I slowly backed away
When he grabbed my throat
Stuck his teeth in my neck
And he told me Your life will never be the same
Sittin' around in my coffin waiting for the sun to go down
Sometimes I get up from my sleep and hang around the town
Well you know there ain't much to do
Except for go to Steak 'N Shake
But all I want is a bloody neck
And not some driedup steak
Down here in Kasey Indiana there ain't much to do at night
No one around Where can a vampire get a bite
I searched the city through and through
And all I find is scum like you
And you are begging to be just like me
I have the power to let you live or take your life away from you
I'm so hungry What will I do
What will I do
Sittin' around in our coffins waiting for the sun to go down
Well time we get up from our sleep and hang around the town
Well you know there ain't much to do except for go to Meijer's store
Well that just ain't good enough
I'm longing for something more
Down here in Kasey Indiana there ain't much to do at night
No one around Where can a vampire get a bite
We go downtown to find some gothic punks who hang out every night
They're weak and helpless but they still put up a fight
After we finish them I ponder on our thoughtabout my life
It just ain't right
Look over there on the TV screen it's another vampire movie
A flying vampire with sharp bloody teeth
The world thinks that's so groovy
Everybody wants to live forever 
They all wish that they could be vampires 
But I wish that I had something better 
For higher
HEY Suck

No no No I don't wanna die
Oh no Oh no no
Get away No don't take my life please
Don't bite me
I don't wanna go

I searched the city through and through
And all I find is scum like you
and you are begging to be just like me
After I finish you I ponder on my thoughtabout my life
It just ain't rightStaying at a hotel in a world not far from here
Sitting in the lobby when a man yells in my ear
I turn to look I see a gun that's pointed at my head
He's upset and he's crying and I think he wants me dead
So what's the meaning of this why do you threaten me this way
He said 'You were sleeping with my wife and now you're gonna pay'
What have I done He probably thought that I was someone
What did I do did he have to shoot me too
Was it coincidence was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
I don't know your wife and I sure don't wanna die
'Shut up cause I know you're lying You're the one she pointed out
Right before I shot her so I know with out a doubt'
But I'm innocent I have a girl not even from this town
'You call my wife a liar Now you're really going down'
He took me from the crowd and made me get down on my knees
Put a barrel to my head as I begged him 'No please'
What have I done He probably thought that I was someone
What did I do did he have to shoot me too
Was it coincidence was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
But now I'm dead so nevermind
Everybody dies I'm no exception to the rule but it wasn't my time to go
My life was taken by a fool He listened to his cheating wife
the intruder got away Security couldn't save me and so now I have to pay
But I'm bleeding on the floor
He's bleeding on the floor
I'm bleeding on the floor
What have I done
I never thought that I was someone else
What did I do did you have to shoot me too
Was it coincidence was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
But now I'm dead so nevermindReady Joe Whatever
Ready Chris Just give me a minute
Alright fellas let's go
Well It's been getting so hard
Livin' with the things you do to me
My dreams are getting so strange
I'd like to tell you everything I see
I see a man at the back
As a matter of fact his eyes are red as the sun
And the girl in the corner let no one ignore her
'Cause she thinks she's the passionate one
Hey it was like lightning everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing and they all started grooving
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
And the man at the back said
Everyone attack and it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said
Boy I wanna warn ya it'll turn into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz ballroom blitz ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
I'm reaching out for something
Touching nothing's all I ever do
I softly call you over
When you appear there's nothing left of you
Now the man in the back is ready to crack
As he raises his hands to the sky
And the girl in the corner is ev'ryone's mourner
She could kill you with a wink of her eye
Oh yeah it was electric so frightfully hectic
And the band started leaving and they all stopped breathing
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
And the man at the back said
Everyone attack and it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said
Boy I wanna warn ya it'll turn into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz ballroom blitz ballroom blitz

And the girl in the corner said
Boy I wanna warn ya it'll turn into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz ballroom blitz ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitzWell there was a little gay man as happy as can be
And one day that little gay man went on my property
Well watching that little gay man made me so very mad
So I looked at that little gay man
And I called him a little fag
I said Hey little gay man get off my property
Hey little gay man I hate your guts can't you see
I don't care if God still loves you don't even come near me
Oh yeah I'm so cool I just told a little gay man to kiss off
Am I a Christian or what
As the little gay man was walking away I realized I done a bad thing today
I said Wait little gay man I'm sorry for what I said
Come back I want to be your friend
I said Hey little gay man God still loves you
Hey little gay man yes it's true
Hey little gay man God still loves you
Hey little gay man I do too
Hey little gay man God still loves you
Hey little gay man you can like girls again
Hey little gay man God still loves you
Hey little gay man drop that sinthere's an image in your drink
is that who you are
a matinee of complications
to kick you in the cleft
and she's calling out your name
is that who you are
sinking feeling when she speaks those words
though I want things to be good
hit the light it won't help you see
I won't be here when you get home
contact will only make it worse
when togetherness is a chore
can't ignore the bad parts
and she's banking on your minutes
but your time is sparse
cover up boost you seratonin
lovely it's a good start
give it up when friendships take formalities
there is no excuse at all
hit the light it won't help you see
I won't be here when you get home
contact will only make it worse
and we're chatting about the open blinds you're contesting what I want
don't want to stay in this
hot room with you tonight hitting the lights
dimming the lights
we can't control what we happen to like it's a lesson in where we are
ideally you might share my life
but this is real time neither side is listeningIf I were an apple hanging on a tree
I'd give myself to the first green worm
And together we would be
He'd make a little hole and live inside of me
He would be my best friend and he'd keep my company
But I am not an apple hanging on a tree
I am nothing but an empty human being
But Jesus wants to come and live inside of me
And be my best friend and keep me company
He wants to show me His way
And He will never leave me
And He will give me ears to hear
And He will give me eyes to see
The perfect plan He has for Him and for me
I'm glad I'm not an apple hanging on a treecall us walking  out of doors
my mind lingers 
for a while
i missed days waiting for it
call us incomplete  when were against
the words that remain
for a while
we hid behind the walls
i missed days waiting for it
so you can't Don't you got better things to do
Than spread your gossip and speak what's untrue
You go to church see through your haughty eyes
Go to your friends and tell all your lies
Go on over to your stupid social clique
You religious hypocrites make me so sick
You without sin go ahead cast the first stone
I didn't think so so why don't you just go home
You claim to be a leader
You claim to make a stand
But when your brother's fallen
You won't even give a hand
You claim to be so holy
You claim to be so strong
But behind your charade
I know your motives are so wrong
It don't mean a thing 'cause talk is cheap
Your actions count but your words you can't keep
You think you're so righteous
But I think you're a creep
You're the kind of person
Who looks at others' sin
And then spreads the word
Forgetting your own within
You go to church to see what's in the news
So you can gossip so you can lie
So you can confuse
See your brothers falling down all the time
Instead of showing mercy you convict them of a crime
You like to watch them as they fall on down
Instead of helping them you push them to the ground
You'll never be a leader
You'll never make a stand
Until you change your ways
My God will not hold out His hand
You claim to be so close to God
Behind the mask motives are wrongin time you'll see with eyes in sing
you learn letters rather i plead
waiting forever is now
red isn't red water is solid
changing shape inside
waiting forever is now
then is what we have
then is what we hadthe world is evil we're all goin to hell
my glass is half empty I don't feel so well
a pessimist from the very start
negative emotions fill my heart
but when I see your pretty face
it's hard to hate the human race
just whisper softly in my ear
I love you more with each passing year
I wanna go to mexico
when I think about you 
when I think about you 
when I think about you 
I remember the good times that we've had
when I think about you 
when I think about you 
when I think about you 
you know my world don't seem so bad
the world is evil we're all goin to hell
my glass is half empty I don't feel so well
a pessimist from the very start
negative emotions fill my heart
but when I see your pretty face
it's hard to hate the human race
just whisper softly in my ear
I love you more with each passing year
I wanna go to mexico
when I think about you 
when I think about you 
when I think about you 
I remember the good times that we've had
when I think about you 
when I think about you 
when I think about you girl 
you know my world don't seem so bad
you know girl
sometimes I wonder when the world is like a monster
it swollows me up and it makes me do things I don't wanna do
ah you can still love me even though I'm inside a monster
I cuss and I scream and the only thing that can calm me down is you
sometimes I wonder when the world is like a monster

when I think about you 
when I think about you 
when I think about you 
when I think about you 
let's goyou see me with your eyes
I wear a good disguise
but somehow you still think you know me
my life is empty now
my heart is blackened out
but I gotta fit in
I also gotta be honest with myself before I kill somebody else
the world has done a number on me
compassion is devoid
I'm always so annoyed
my selfishness it now concedes me
but that's ok 'cause no one seems to recognize me anyway
I'm mistaken for someone else constantly througout my day
I won't get caught 'cause no one knows that I'm an american psycho
I know what brand you wear
I know what kind of pair of pants and shoes and shirts you have on
I dine expensively with a hard body next to me
but she likely won't see your next thought
but that's ok 'cause no one seems to recognize me anyway
I'm mistaken for someone else constantly througout my day
I won't get caught 'cause no one knows that I'm an american psycho
that I'm an american psycho
it's so sad we only seem to care
about our face and hair
and what makes us look good
your business card is better
you have a bigger room
that could lead to your doom
and I really think it should
did you make it to the top of the world just to die
I own all the name brands
I have a nicer tan
I excersize and work out daily
I rent some videos
watch the patty winter show
my mind it thinks irrationally
but that's ok 'cause no one seems to recognize me anyway
I'm mistaken for someone else constantly througout my day
I won't get caught 'cause no one cares that I'm an american psycho
that I'm an american psycho that I'm an american psycho
it's so sad we only seem to care
about our face and hair
and what makes us look good
your business card is better
you have a bigger room
that could lead to your doom
and I really think it should
it's so sad we only seem to care
about our face and hair
and what makes us look good
your business card is better
you have a bigger room
that could lead to your doom
and I really think it should
did you make it to the top of the world just to die
oh did you make it to the top of the world just to die
you're gonna dieI turn on the TV and what do I see
Murder and violence and pornography
I turn on the radio and it brings me to tears
All of the lies fed to the ears
A Hollywood puppet you are
If you can be sleazy you'll be a star
You're the devil's puppet hanging on a string
Dear Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails
You say God is dead and we're all going to Hell
Well I got something to say He's alive today
And he loves you so and he wants you to know
You're killing the kids They're following you
You're feeding them lies 'cause that's what you do
You're the devil's puppet hanging on a string
Go to LA Go to New York City
Hearts have grown cold oh what a pity
Sex without love and selfrespect gone
Drink yourself to death and party till dawn
You say I'm fanatical 'cause I try to live right
Pleasing to God Holy in His sight
Well I know someone that you don't know
His name is Jesus and He loves you so
And He wants you to know
People today are looking for something
To chase away that empty nothing
They don't want God they push Him away
They say they'll find him some other day
So they look to drugs they look to a psychic
Looking for something but they'll never find it
You're the devil's puppet hanging on a stringWell I woke up that night to take a pee
Decided to look under the tree
Well what did I see Oh it was he stuffing the stocking for me
It was my dad
He said Son you're going on 19 It's time to face reality
There is no Santa Claus Face it if you can
Cause Santa Claus was really just a man
Santa Claus was just a man Santa Claus was just a man
Why was I lied to It's so hard to understand
Santa Claus was just a man Santa Claus was just a man
Now I'm very mad cause Santa Claus was really just my dad
He sat me down that morning to explain
But all the words he told me were in vain
Because the lie that I was living had led me to believe
That Santa Claus was more than just a dream
He was my dad
Santa Claus was just a man Santa Claus was just a man
Why was I lied to It's so hard to understand
Santa Claus was just a man Santa Claus was just a man
Now I'm very mad cause Santa Claus was really just my dad
Lied to and deceived Why is this world trying to trick me
Lied to and deceived It's all makebelieveOld Man Thorn he was good
He was just misunderstood
He never took nobody's life
So how come his ended in strife
They came in one gloomy night
Came with the darkness stole the light
They took him out back and bashed his head
One month later he was found dead
Is there anybody out there
Is there anybody listening
If there's a God oh could You hear Him
Was he screaming out in vain
Did You even know his name
Julie was a sweet little girl
Said a prayer before every meal
So how come Father was so bad
She couldn't even call him Dad
He made her live her life in pain
Took her trust made her insane
Where were You when he broke her down
Did You even hear a sound
Is there anybody out there
Is there anybody listening
If there's a God oh could You hear her
Was she crying out in vain
Did You even know her name
Life is short and life is gray
What am I living for anyway
Consequences I must pay
If I don't get it right today
The world just seems so unfair
We are living in the monster's lair
I need to know You're on the throne
I wonder when You'll take us home
I know there is somebody out there
I know there is somebody listening
There is a God and He can hear me
I'm not screaming out in vain
And I know He knows my nameAm I bein untrue
when i blame it on you
afterall I'm the one who let you go in 
I'm sorry to say
that I gave you away
to somebody else I fear I'll never see you again 
I should of stopped you
instead of turning away
losing your love
is a regret to this day
if I loved you at all
I could find words to say
but I didn't
so now it's too late
I should have said
don't go into the woods
don't let go of my hand
I should have said
don't go into the woods
do you understand me
woah
Am I bein untrue
when i blame it on you
afterall I'm the one who let you go in it's all my fault now
that I gave you away
to somebody else I fear I'll never see you again because of my own sin
is it because
you finished it second place
but that's not true baby
don't you know that you won that race
I guess I should've informed you
'cause I miss your sweet face
and now your gone
and now your gone without a trace
I should have said
don't go in to unknow places
young girls vanish without traces
I could not let that happen to you
woah
but if you leave me oh just maybe
strangers in the dark are waiting
when you're gone there's nothing I can do
there's animals in that woods
and there's shadows in that woods
oh baby there's manaics in that woods
but you're taking your chances
ain't no second glances
but you're taking your chances
Nooo
don't go in to unknow places
young girls vanish without traces
I could not let that happen to you
woah
but if you leave me oh just maybe
strangers in the dark are waiting
when you're gone there's nothing I can do
NOO
don't go into the woods
don't go into the woodsYou go right I'll go left
Sometimes we don't agree
But that's okay 'cuz in the end
We're still brothers you and me
We'll go to Steak 'N' Shake sometimes
'Cuz we hang out every night
And we do the same ol' thing
Sometimes we fool around too much
'Cuz we are a frisky bunch
We get in trouble everyday
Hey Ho Straight through the heart
I'm for you and I know you're there for me
Give me a high 5
Hey Ho Friends till the end
Can't you see that's the way it's got to be
You're the money and the bomb
But I talk about your mom
Even though it isn't right
Go to Mikey's play some games
Stay up till the break of day
Maybe get into a fight
Even though we're hittin' 20
And we haven't yet matured
You know I think it's kinda funny
That we're all a bunch of nerds
Can't you see God has destined us to beWhat is this I see Can we not get along
Discord in the body shows me something is wrong
Difference of opinion brings about your hate
The way that we view life makes you so irate
Why can't you see there's no unity
in the way you hate me just because we don't agree
Send us your hate mail in the name of Christ
Insult us bash us but don't play nice
I'm sure the Father's proud of the way you treat your brother
It's sad to say the Christian way is beating up each other
Not everything is black and white
What makes us wrong What makes you right
I'm a Christian too but I would never want to be like you
We see things differently
You don't know my heart and you don't know me
Stop holding this grudge why don't you let God be my judge
Your convictions they are not mine The way you act is out of lineYou're a spoiled brat
Oh yes it's true
You're stuck on self
Nobody matters but you
Forget about the hungry in Mexico
Go play your stupid Nintendo
We've got everything we want
We're ungrateful spoiled little brats
We need a humble self esteem
Stop living for a selfish dream
We need to stop
Taking it for granted
All the wonderful things
That He does for us
We don't deserve
All of His grace
We let stupid things take His place
It's a wonder why
We have trouble living for God
Always watching that MTV
We have all the stupid things
That we could ever want
But we're missing out on
The one thing that we needI wanna be popular I wanna be a movie star
I wanna be noticed I wanna go far
I wanna make money I wanna live in glamour
I wann have a big house I wanna drive a sports car
But you know that I don't got it probably never have it
God was playin' a joke when he made me
I don't have any money I don't even have a job
I'm not a movie star and I'll probably never be
I wish I was a hunk I wish I was muscular
Why can't I be good looking why can't I be taller
I wish my teeth were white and wish my butt was tight
I wish I had a big chest you know I wish I was the best
And you know that I don't got it probably never have it
God's got a sense of humor just look at me
I'm not a hunk I don't work out
I'm not a model and I'll never be
I think someone up above has put a curse on me
I wish I had a friend I wish I had a buddy
Someone to care for me someone to love me
Well just last week that wish came true
I used to be a geek now I'm someone new
I was down on my luck when He stole my heart
He showed me I was somebody He gave me a brand new start
I wish I was popular I wish I was a movie star
I wish I was a superhunk I wish I was muscular
But I know that I don't got it probably never have it
A movie star and a hunk I'll never be
But that's okay because I found something
I got more I got someone to live for and I know that He loves me
His name is Jesus He helped create me
I child of God is what I be
He wasn't playing a joke
We're all made in His image
He's got a plan just for me
He's got a place just for me
He's got a place wait and seeI'm a gangster now look at me

Nine pretend to be so tough Ten get a rude attitude

This time it's in Kokomo and it's happening to me
Somebody help me

They're chasing me all around
Kill the zombies
Before they take us all down
Kill the zombies
What am I supposed to do
Everyone's got the virus
Chris Retfield where are you
Help me overcome this
Dead dogs are chasing me
And so are giant spiders
This evil nightmare just can't be
Here come the hunters
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
Everyone's dead I'm the only one still alive
I feel the lickers they're on my tail
Oh God save me from this hell
Somebody help me
Kill the zombies
Before they destroy the town
Kill the zombies
They're chasing me all around
Kill the zombies
Before they take us all down
Kill the zombies
I run down a dark alley
To escape the monsters
I hear them coming after me
Now they've got me cornered
This can't be happening
It's unbelievable
Won't someone please save me
From this Resident EvilNow Johnny took a trip to Brazil
To spread the truth to preach what is real
When he got back home he had such a fire
But just a month later he lost his desire
Now the world was calling he couldn't miss out
Closed his Bible and he started to doubt
He ditched all his Christian friends and he went back to the worldly trends
He said Why can't we keep it Our quiet times and relationships
Why do we fall away so fast
We gotta fight the fight day by day and night by night
That's the only way we're going to last We're gonna last
Now all through the summer Jill was for real
Well she had a fire that no one could steal
And then school started Got back to the clique
Lost her faith so darn quick
Well at first ya know she tried to keep it
It was too hard she just couldn't do it
Closed her Bible went back to the crowd
As her quiet time fell to the ground
She said Why can't we keep it Our quiet times and relationships
Why do we fall away so fast
We gotta fight the fight day by day and night by night
That's the only way we're going to last We're gonna last
Can't warm ourselves with the crowd Can't put our Bibles down
Why can't we keep it Our quiet times and relationships
Why do we fall away so fast
We gotta fight the fight day by day and night by night
That's the only way we're goingYou'll think of this when summer fades
Flowers in your hair smile on your face
Kisses and hugs and wishing wells
And the laughing and the cheering and the wedding bells
Time will take it's toll beware
But I will never cease to care
I crossed many mountains getting here
To see that ring on your hand my dear
And as we look inside our hearts tonight
You know we'll find it's true
There's something old something new something borrowed and blue
There's something old something new borrowed and blue
In Paul's letter to the Corinthians
He speaks of the blessings loving lends
And though true love may not seek it's own
You know I'll seek you should you wander too far from home
And as we look inside our hearts tonight you know we'll find it's true
There's something old something new something borrowed and blue
There's something old something new borrowed and blue
Borrowed and blue   
Borrowed and blue   Sleep around with Kristi
And get some weird disease
Then move on to Jamie
And give it if you please
Forgot to wear a condom
When you were with Louise
Now you know that she's got
She's got that weird disease yeah
Sleep around sleep around
Do you even care
Get it here give it there
You sure do like to share
Sleep around sleep around
Do you sleep and tell
Control those horny hormones
Or die and go to hell
Yeah
After Louise came Elenore
And after her came many more
What do you think God is saying
When he sees you and his daughters playing
All I know is that if I were the boss
I'd send you to hell you wouldn't be a loss
But Jesus Christ is more forgiving than me
He gives you a chance to set yourself free indeed
Sleep around sleep around
Do you even care
Get it here give it there
You sure do like to share
Sleep around sleep around
Do you sleep and tell
Control those horny hormones
Or die and go to hell
Sleep around sleep around
You're throwing your life away
You're doin' those girls and gettin' some thrills
But one day you're gonna pay
YeahI need a job
I need somethin' to show me I ain't nothin'
I need money I need moolah and I need it fast
I need a job I gotta start workin'
I'm getting sick and tired of moochin'
There are things I want to do and I need cash
But I'll show the world
They say I'm wrong but I know I'm right
I'll show the world with my God by my side
I'll show the world
Maybe I'm a dreamer far from reality
They see a loser baby when they look at me
I should conform to this society
But I say no thanks cause I'm gonna reach my dream
And I'll show the world
They call me clown People look at me and frown
But I'm followin' Jesus and He's got my crown 
Maybe I should growup but I'm in it way to deep
Maybe I'm a disappointment
I'm the family's black sheep
But I'll show the worldDarkness bathes the city face
It's something common to the human race
Go about your normal lives
Do whatever and pay no mind
Just remember to look behind you
Something sinister's about to unfold
It happens every night yet no one is told
A lone stranger walks the streets below
What happens next you don't wanna know
They are everywhere
I tried to warn you but you don't care
Soul Stalker is about to strike
You don't believe me
Why exactly I don't know
All I want to do is help save your soul
The formal warning is out
And the rest is up to you
You can choose to make a difference
Or do what you always do
But beware of the rulers of darkness
For there is no mercy in them
They'll rape your soul and mind
And try to take you down with them
Here we come
We're here to save you
From the evil clutches of the Dragon's fleet
We are the hunters
Ordained by the King of kings
Our mission spread the Word
And rid the world of evil things
You go about your normal lives
You do whatnot and you pay no mind
It's a risk you would not take
If you knew the cost at stake
It's a vicious cycle that never ends
So we must stop it before it beginsWell you're a good looking guy and you're under 21
You party all night and you have a lot of fun
You dropped out of school and you do nothing all day
You can't seem to find a job but that's ok
Cause you live with your girlfriend and she takes care of you
You share the same bed and you promise to be true
She wants to get married but you'd rather not
The only reason you like her is because she's hot
Get a Life
Well you're getting nowhere and you're getting there fast
Your heathen lifestyle's not gonna last
You're wasting your life but you don't care
You're living for today for the prince of the air
Your life is a party and it sure ain't dull
You're living for today and you're on a roll
You don't have a worry you think all is well
But you don't know you're on your way to Hell
Get a Life
Now every weekend is the same routine
You get hooked up and you do the same old thing
You smoke some marijuana get as high as a kite
Take down 3 more beers get into another fight
Go upstairs with a girl and sleep around
Wake up the next morning find yourself on the ground
This socalledlife that you live is full of sin
But my God can set you free if you would just let Him in
Get a Life
Okay in your world you're so freakin' cool
But in our world you are nothing
And you need to get a life
Get a Life
KGBstayin in a hotel not far from here
sittin in the lobby
when anhills in my ear
i turned to look
i see a gun pointed at my head
hes cussin and hes cryin
and i think he wants me dead
so whats the meaning of this
why did he threaten me
this way he said
you were sleeping with my wife and now your gonna pay
What have i done
must have thought i was someone else
what did i do
i dont think that i know you
its a coincidence
i was in the wrong place at the wrong time
i dont know your wife
and i sure dont wanna die
well now shut up
cuz i know your lying
your the one she pointed out
right before i shot her
so i know without a doubt
im innocent
i have a girl not even from this town
you call my wife a liar
now your really going down
he took me from the crowd
and made me get on my knees
put the barrel to my head
as i begged him
no please
What have i done
must have thought i was someone else
what did i do
i dont think that i know you
its a coincidence
was in in the wrong place at the wrong time
but now im dead so never mind
well everybody dies
im no exception to the rule
but it wasnt my time to go
my life was taken by a fool
he listened to his cheating wife
his ruler got away
security couldnt save me
and so now i had to pay
im bleeding on the floor
hes bleeding on the floor
im bleeding on the floor
What have i done
must have thought i was someone else
what did i do
i dont think that i know you
its a coincidence
was in in the wrong place at the wrong time
but now im dead so never mindAnd I looked
I looked up at the stars
and found the brightest pair
the ones I could compare
to your eyes and then
As nightfall turned to day
I watched them fade away
As nightfall turned to day
I watched you fade away
Never will I
let go of what I love
and what she means to me
the reason I can't sleep
is the reason I miss her
Its a feeling that no words
will never be enough
will never be enough
will never be enough
Another lonely night
without her by my side
take all that I am
Im wishing you goodnight
Another lonely night
without her by my side
take all that I am
Im wishing you goodnight
43 minutes past one
Do you remember that time
I'll give you all that I have
I'll give you all that is mine
I'll keep my promise sincere
I'll keep the thought of you near
I'll be there every time
Just like the shine of your eyes
Another lonely night
without her by my side
take all that I am
Im wishing you goodnight
Another lonely night
without her by my side
take all that I am
Im wishing you goodnight33caseyyIt's far past the nightfall
and we're still awake
you whispered to me a sweet serenade
Bloodshot eyes never cry
Courageous hearts never die
Scream silence now
I've always been listening to cries so deafening
From the bottom from the bottom of my heart and the top of my lungs
if I can lose my voice I'd lose is just for you
This blanket I tore it apart
just so you know that I'd keep you warm
Bloodshot eyes never cry
Courageous hearts never die
Scream silence now
I've always been listening to cries so deafening
From the bottom from the bottom of my heart and the top of my lungs
if I can lose my voice I'd lose it just for youTake your eyes and see me now
Before I take what you took of me
Lay my head on bloodless hands tonight
Drown in tears the clear but poison wine
Well I need what you owe
Will you pay me back in bandaged covered wrists
Don't you know
The feeling of a cutthroat lover's kiss
Please don't go
Breaking other hearts just like this just like this
Cause I'm the only one who sees you in the darkness of the night
And even though we're distant I dream of you despite
the sickle in between us that ruins and divides
And even though your gone I'll love you all of my lifeDont say goodbye
is what I begged that night
And every tear you cry is what makes me die
So dont let me die I wont let you cry tonight
Breathe this life away from me
A breath away will always be
How you you and me will always be
Take my last breath its your to keep
And when I fall from the rooftops above
I'll spread warmth to the ground with my love and my blood
And no one will notice that Im gone
But deep down inside I hoped that I was wrong
Breathe this life away from me
A breath away will always be
How you you and me will always be
Take my last breath its your to keep
With a gun in her hand shes my shooting star
Breathe this life away from me
A breath away will always be
How you you and me will always be
Take my last breath its your to keepI'll cut an X over my heart
Blood drips from the corners of the room
As these walls scream imperfections through
torn flesh and broken bones
Then you'll ask me what have I done
Tell me what havent you done if
guilty lips are not so innocent
A bullet with your name right through my chest proving love was worth dying for
A bullet with your name right through my chest proving love was worth dying for
Tear those wings right off your back
And innocence is what you lack
and when the trail leads back to me
Apologies are all the same
and this is how we play the game
Show me a new way to bleedLike kings and queens we dance
To keep this night alive
Honestly we're just too honest
Full blooded friends don't break their promise
You don't Have to be blood to be family
Wake up to all the town
Its way to late but were still down
Its way to late but were still down
Dance with me
This should be the soundtrack to the show
Look out We're always asking for
We play for keeps in this game of loss
We love to laugh and laugh and love
We dance to show them what kings and queens are made of
Singing a life with no regrets
There's no time and I feel better spent
With my best friends
Honestly we're just too honest
Full blooded friends don't break their promise
You don't have to be blood to be family
Wake up to all the town
It's way to late but were still down
It's way to late but were still down
Why can't we all just sing along
Why can't we all just sing along
Why can't we all just sing along
Why can't we
Why can't we


Engulfed in the flames
while I'm screaming your name
can you hear me this last time
Gasoline sunsets
wake us from our rest
as the darkest sky ignites



Engulfed in the flames
while I'm screaming your name
can you hear me this last time
Gasoline sunsets
wake us from our rest
as the darkest sky ignites



Cross my heart
and hope to die
with the gasoline sunset lighting up the sky 
Cross my heart
and hope to die
with the gasoline sunset lighting up the sky
tonightAugust and September
Summertime is done
Days of sweet November
Grow shorter one by one
Autumn leaves are falling
And wintertime is near
It's getting very close
To that special time of year
The snow will be the whitest
Stars will shine the brightest
Bells will ring out merry and clear
When we all get home for Christmas this year
The kids will want the day off
Trying hard to stay up
Waiting for Saint Nick to appear
When we all get home for Christmas this year
With Mom and Dad to meet us
And dear old friends to greet us
We will have the sweetest of holidays
And when it's time for parting
We'll recall the fun we had
And think of all the love that was here
And we'll all get home for Christmas next year
Yes we'll all get home for Christmas next year
With Mom and Dad to meet us
And dear old friends to greet us
We will have the sweetest of holidays
And when it's time for parting
We'll recall the fun we had
And think of all the love that was here
Then we'll all come home for Christmas next year
Yes we'll all come home for Christmas next year
Next Christmas
The snow will be the whitest
Stars will be shine their brightest
The kids will want they day off
Trying hard to stay up
Mom and Dad will meet us
Dear old friends to greet us
At Christmas
At ChristmasAway in a manger no crib for his bed
the little Lord Jesus laid down his Sweet head
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay
The cattle are lowing the baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes
I love thee Lord Jesus Look down from the sky
And stay by my side until morning is nigh
Be near me Lord Jesus I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever and love me I pray
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care
And fit us for heaven to live with thee thereOur Father
Who art in heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth as in heaven
Give us today
Our daily bread
And forgive our sins
As we forgive
Each one of those
Who sins against us
And lead us
Not to the time of trial
But deliver us from evil
For Thine is the kingdom
The power and the glory
Let all the people
Say amen
In every tribe
And tongue
Let every heart's
Desire be joined
To see the kingdom come
Let every hope
And every dream
Be born in love again
Let all the world
Sing with one voice
Let the people
Say amenray of hope flickers in the sky
A tiny star lights up way up high
All across the land dawns a brand new morn'
This comes to pass when a child is born
A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds of change whisper in the trees
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn
This comes to pass when a child is born
A rosy dawn settles all around
You got to feel you're on solid ground
For a spell or two no one seems forlorn
This come to pass when a child is born
It's all a dream an illusion now
It must come true some time soon somehow
All across the land dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is bornDo nothing till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seams of anyone's dreams
Is over my head
Do nothing till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the words of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I've been untrue
When we're apart
The words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memories
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothing till you hear it from me
And you never will
interlude
Some kiss may cloud my memories
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothing till you hear it from me
And you never willDashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Oh jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
jimmy shang and kenya
Was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We got into a drifted bank
And we all fell in the snow
what a way to go
Oh jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh yeahWhen you find the one and only
It's like findin' a needle in the hay
Ev'ryone of us is lookin' for love
So when love comes along
You can't let it get away
When you're someone's one and only
And he says that he's nothin' without you
When at last you know where you belong
Then you're one of the chosen few
Yes you're one of the chosen few
Well I found my one and only
Like the long lonesome river finds the sea
And I can't believe how lucky I was
That you and your love were waitin' around for me
You're my darlin' one and only
I've got no more lookin' left to doOoh I loved you so
But why I loved you I'll never know
You found a reason for leavin'
Soon as I gave my love to you
And oh ah whoa the pain you put me through
You don't care 'bout my love for you huh
But I found a reason for livin'
And I'm through with cryin' over you
And now I feel a song in my heart again
I knew as soon as I felt him lookin' through me
I feel a song in my heart again
High on the wings of the things he's doin' to me
Oh that a man is fine
Ooh what's even better the man is mine
He makes me feel just like a woman
Something that you could never do
And now I feel a song in my heart again
I found a man who can put it all together
I feel a song in my heart again
I'm gonna love him and make it last forever


Oh oh oh it feels so good
You you you you you never understood
He makes me feel like I'm somethin'
And I'm gonna keep him if I can

Now I can open my eyes to a new door
I feel a song in my heart again
The man is all that I need to fill my love up

His kind of lovin' I can never get enough of

On and onEvery Beat Of My Heart
Rod Stewart
Through these misty eyes I see lonely skies
Lonely road to Babylon
Where's my family
And my country
heaven knows where I belong
Pack my bags tonight
Here's one Jacobite
Who must leave or surely die
Put me on a train
In the pouring rain say farewell
but don't say goodbye
Seagull carry me over land and sea
To my own folk that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home
One more glass of wine
Just for auld lang syne
And the girl I left behind
How I miss her now In my darkest hour
And the way our arms entwine
Seagull carry me over land and sea
To my own folk that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home
And we'll drink a toast
To the blood red rose
Cheer a while the
Emerald Isle
And to the northern lights
And the swirling pipes
How they make a grown man cry
Seagull carry me over land and sea
To my own folk that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going homeI've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons
To keep on keepin' on 
Got to make the best of a bad situation 
Ever since that day I woke up and found
That you were gone 
Darkness all around me
Blackin' out the sun
Old friends call me
But I just don't feel like talkin to anyone
Emptiness has found me
And it just won't let me go
Go right on livin'
But why I just don't know
 Yes I am
 staring down reality
Don't do me no good
'Cause our misunderstanding
Is too well understood 
Such a sad sad season 
When a good love dies 
Not a day goes by 
When I don't realize 
I've really got to use my imagination 
To think of good reasons 
To keep on keepin' on 
I've got to make the best of a bad situation 
Ever since that day I woke up and found that you were gone

 my imagination
 to think of good reasons
 to keep on pushin' on
I said I've got to make the best of 
Of a bad situation 
Ever since that day I woke up and found that you were gone
 I really got to use
 that imagination gotta think of good reasonHey you know everybody's talkin' about the good old days
Everybody the good old days
The good old days
Well let's talk about the good old days
Come to think about it
As bad as we think they are
These will become the good old days of our children
Why don't we try to remember
The kind of September
When life was slow and oh so mellow
Try to remember
And if you remember
Then follow
Why does it always seem the past is better
We look back and think
The winters were warmer
The grass was greener
The skies were bluer
The smiles were brighter
Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
And if we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me
Would we
Could we
Memories like the corners of my mind
Memories
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were
Oh can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
And if we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me
Would we
Could we
Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we'll remember
We'll remember
Whenever we remember
The Way We WereMm
Here comes the mailman walking up the street
And it looks like he has a letter today for me
Wait a minute let me look inside no it couldn't be from my guy
Because he he brought me 
I said he he brought me 
A letter full of tears
I thought we had a love so strong 
It would take a lifetime to break us apart
Oh yes
But I found out today I was wrong
And my reward was a broken heart my my heart
Oh here comes the teardrops welcome a welcome to my eyes
And I couldn't hold 'em back no matter if I tried
Woo woo oh
You know it hurt me so inside
Won't you pardon me while I cry
Because he brought me 
I said he brought me a letter full of tears
 Those aren't drip drop tears 
Can't you see them falling 
Woo oh woo woo oh woo woo oh oh oh hey yes he did hey hey  yes he did hey
Hey hey woo
Yes he did
I thought 
We had a love so strong
It's sad to think
We're not gonna make it
And it's gotten to the point
Where we just can fake it 
For some ungodly reason
We just won't let it down 
I guess neither one of us 
Wants to be the first to say goodbye
I keep on wondering 
What I'm gonna do with out ya 
And I guess you must be
Wondering that same thing too 
So we go on
Go on together living our lives 
Because neither one of us 
Wants to be the first to say goodbye
Ooh every time I find the nerve
Every time I find the nerve to say I'm leavin' 
Oh memories those old memories
Get in my way 
Oh Lord knows it's only me only knows it's only me
That I'm deceiving
When it comes to say goodbye
That's a simple word that I just cannot say
There can be no way 
This can have a happy ending 
So we just go on 
Hurting and pretending
And convincing ourselves
To give it just one more try 
Because neither one of us 
Wants to be the first to say
Neither one of us 
Wants to be the first to say
Neither one of us 
Wants to be the first to say
Farewell my love goodbye Now if I should walk away
From this freedom I now possess
Honey you must do the same
Without having any regrets no
And you must offer me more
Than your promise of treating me right
Whoa oh oh it's gotta be that way
Now I don't mean to save my bill
I must have money to be extreme
Just give me a lot of love and care
Oh honey and all of those things
And I won't ask no more of you
Than I wouldn't do for you myself
Whoa oh oh it's gotta be that way
It's gotta be that way
Now we can't judge what we've got
By the people living next door
Even though Mr Jones makes
Ooh and he has a whole lot more
But instead let's make each other feel
That having our love is twice as much
Whoa oh oh it's gotta be that way
Now should our mothers say something
About maybe doing each other wrong
I'd simply say we can work it out
And politely ask them to leave us alone
And we won't let our friends interfere
Let our problems to them be unknown
Whoa oh oh it's gotta be that way
It's gotta be that way
I want to say it's gotta be that way
It's gotta be that way
It's gotta be that way Lord Lord
And if I give you all I've got
I want all that you've got to give
Whoa oh oh it's gotta be that way
It's gotta be that way
Now if you should sometimes
Want to be out with the boys
It's alright with me go ahead
If that's really what you enjoy
And if I want to be with the girls
Playing cards and all those kinds of games
Whoa oh oh it's gotta be that way
Now I'm not trying to be demanding
I just want to have a little understanding
'Cause this ain't no game we're about to play
Lord Lord
And a good foundation is based on
A lot of love and sacrifice
Whoa oh oh it's gotta be that way
It's gotta be that way
I wanna say it's gotta be that way
Can't you understand can't you understand
It's gotta be that way
No matter how much I love you babe
It's gotta be that way
If I give all I've got to you
It's gotta be that wayAnd this is love this is love
The apple tree
That stood and watched our first kiss
The glue I bought
So you could mend my favorite dish
Oh the broken vase
I once threw at you and missed
And this is love
A story of love
Your checkered handkerchief
The one I used when my kitten died
And birthday cakes
A box of tunes a TV guide
Ah catching cold
Trudging through the rain for a mile
To get some special gifts
For your sister and her child
And that little dream house
That sits up on that sunny hill
And all the dreams we had that
This house our kids would one day fill
And this is love oh and this is love
Don't you know that this is love
The story of love glory of love
A birthday party for Lorraine
And drinking too much pink champagne
The hand that struck through jealousy
And broke the ties between you and me
A little heart that would not forget
And wondering how I'm gonna live
With nothing left but hurt and pain
Try and try and try again
And this is love oh and this is love
Don't you know that this is love
The story of love
A snapshot pasted to my mind
Of all the things I've left behind
A book of poems a favorite record
And how you used to cheat at checkers
The tree that spied on our first kiss
That old broken broken dish
Whoa all of these things I truly miss
But don't you know don't you know
That this is love oh and this is love
Don't you know that this is love
The story of love
Na na na
Too much bubbling pink champagne
Nothing left but hurt and pain
Maybe a poem and one or two records
Can't nobody beat you
When you're cheating at checkers
Na na naGivin' up is hard to do
When you really love someone
Givin' up is hard to do
When you still depend upon
His warm and tender touch
His kiss and his caress
That used to mean so much
And bring you happiness
 oh Lord is hard to do
I try but it's just no use
 whoa Lord it's hard to do
I tried but I can't break loose
The light of hope burns dim
But in my heart I pray
My love my love my love and faith in him
Will bring him back someday

But it's just no use

No I can't break loose
Whether he knows or not
He really needs me too
Oh Lord oh Lord oh Lord he's all I've got
And giving up
Is so hard to do

Oh yes it is

Is so hard to do

Oh yes it is

I just can't break loose

No no no no

I just can't break loose
No no noThey tell me Gladys you know you love too hard
But I tell 'em not nearly hard enough
They say girlfriend you know you go too far
Around the world ain't far enough
'Cause I only wanna show you what you mean to me
Every time I'm reachin' out to you I start to sink
I may be drowning with desire from your sweet sweet touch
I don't care what people say 'cause I love you so much
Love overboard
My love's in need of help
Love overboard
I sure can't help myself
Love overboard
I don't know what to do
Love overboard
I'm so in love with you baby
Baby they say I work too hard
Not really when it comes to lovin' you
You've got my overtime you bring me peace of mind
And there's so much more I'd like to do
I only wanna find the love my heart's been searchin' for
I'd climb most every mountain swim from shore to shore
Just to feel the soft caress from your warm embrace
In this ocean of love no one can take your place
Love overboard
Oh my love's in need of help
Love overboard
Sure can't help myself
Love overboard
I don't know what to do
Love overboard
So in love with you
Love overboard
I'm running out of time
Love overboard
I'm 'bout to lose my mind
Love overboard
I don't know what to do
Love overboard
I'm so in love with you
All my friends keep telling me to let you go
Between the two of us how could they ever know
About the love you been givin'
Seems some people like to live their life so very close
I like to let go sometime so I can flow with the time
I've done made up my mind you're the only one for me
Oh my love's overboard

I'm overboard
Can't help myself
I'm overboard
Uh the bottom may be deep
But your love so very sweet
Well overboard
Love overboard
Love overboard
So in love with you
Love overboard
Runnin' out of time
Love overboard
About to lose my mind
Love overboard
I don't know what to do
Love overboard
So in love with you
Spinnin' fallin'
People aah people
Love's callin' I'm fallin'
SOSOSOSOS
Love's overboard
My love's in need of help
Love overboard
I just can't help myself
Love overboard
I don't know what to do
Love overboardWe've come a long way from nowhere
The road was often paved with tears and pain
Whenever I got lost you were always there
Through it all you never once complained
There were times I know you thought
The sun would never find us
Sometimes I felt that same way too
Now it looks as if all the hard times are behind us
One by one our dreams are coming true
Love finds its own way
Through the darkest night
Love finds its own way
It needs no guiding light
Whoa oh it only needs two people
With a dream and endless faith
And given time and a little patience
Love finds its own way
I know you must have pushed aside your feelings
When down inside you thought you'd fall apart
And if it hadn't been for your believin' 
We might still be stumblin' in the dark 
Now we're standing on the threshold of a new beginning
The doors of life are opened wide
For once in our lives we're finally winnin'
All because love is on our side
Ooh love finds its own way
Through the darkest night
Love finds its own way
It needs no guiding light
Because love love finds its own way
Through the darkest night
Love love love finds its own wayI've had my share of life's ups and downs
But fate's been kind the downs have been few
I guess you could say that I've been lucky
Well I guess you could say that it's all because of you
If anyone should ever write my life story
For whatever reason there might be
Oh you'll be there between each line of pain and glory
Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me
Ah you're the best thing that ever happened to me
Oh there have been times when times were hard
But always somehow I made it I made it through
Cause for every moment that I've spent hurting
There was a moment that I spent ah just loving you
If anyone should ever write my life story
For whatever reason there might be
Oh you'll be there between each line of pain and glory
Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me
Ah you're the best thing that ever happened to meI know that we both talked it over
And said it's best to forget
And we'll leave all our memories behind us
It's better ended and yet
So sad the song of
Of two empty lives
When that moment of truth
Suddenly arrives
And so sad the song
Of what might have been
You see a lifetime of dreams
Scattered in the wind
Together
We belong together
Never was that one lovely word
Easier to say
And so sad the song
Of just remembering when
Knowing the love of your life
Will never come again
So sad the song
That says goodbye
Together
We belong together
And I'll love you forever
On that you can rely
So would it be wrong
To give our love
Just one more try
So sad the song
That says goodbye

That says goodbyeSay you wanna be loved
But you won't let me love you
Say you want someone to trust in you baby
Can't you see that's what I'm tryin' to do
I know you've been hurt before
And you're afraid to try love once more
Without love by your side you're only half alive
'Cause everybody needs love oh yeah
Everybody needs love
Say you wanna be kissed
But you won't let me kiss you
Say you wanna be missed
Can't you see how my arms are missing you
She's got you hurting so inside
Now with love you try to hide
But no matter how you try
Without love you can't survive
'Cause everybody needs love oh yeah
Everybody needs love
Oh love's alright
You need love I need love
Everybody needs love
Baby don't you know that
You need love and I need love
Everybody needs love oh yeah
Everybody needs love
Say you wake up in the morning yes you will
Feeling ooh so empty inside
I bet I know what your trouble is baby
You need someone like me by your side
I know you've been hurt before
But don't be afraid to try love once more
'Cause without love you'll find
You'll have no peace of mind
'Cause everybody needs love oh yeah
Everybody needs love
You need love and I need love
Everybody needs love love love
You need love I sure need love
Everybody needs loveThanks to Char Star for these lyrics

This hurt inside is too much for me
Just walk in my shoes
You'll see I want the love that used to be
Try on my heartache
Go ahead and try it on for size
Just walk in my shoes
Then you'll see through someone else's eyes
What you've done to me
I fell apart when you walked out

 Oh baby

Well why don't you walk walk walk in my shoes 
And you'll wear a smile that isn't real
Just walk in my shoes
And you'll know how broken up I feel
Try out each new day
Wear the cloak of loneliness I know
Just walk in my shoes
Or do you since you let me go
 Keep on walking walk on
 Walk on
Darling I fell apart
Baby baby baby when you walked out

 Whoa oh baby

Well why don't you walk walk walk in my shoes 
And I pray that you'll remember when
And if the shoe fits
Won't you say you want my love again
 Keep on walking walk on
Time is all important to everything
It seems to be an ongoing thing
When you're dealing with pain
Love and the fact that you've lost it
When I met you I was introduced to love and
After a period of time I came to be friends with pain
I've dealt with these emotions and I hope that I've come through
So if you don't mind
Walk softly when you walk by me
'Cause my heart is still don't shake it up
Now that I've cried my love to sleep

Don't wake it up don't wake it up

Now that I've cried my love to sleep

Don't wake it up don't wake it up

If I seem distant and reserved when we meet
Don't take the time to ask me why
'Cause it's bad enough that I've lost you
Ohh don't make it rough ohh just say hello and goodbye
Tip toe when you pass by me
'Cause my heart is still don't shake it up
Now that I've cried my love to sleep

Don't wake it up ooh don't wake it up

Yeah I just cried my love to sleep

Ooh don't wake it up don't wake it up

I fall apart each time I look in your eyes
Remembering things I should forget
Ooh my love's a spark but it could burst into flames
'Cause I'm not over you yet
Walk softly when you walk by me
Ooh my heart is still don't shake it up
Now that I've cried my love to sleep

Ooh don't shake it up don't wake it up

Ooh baby now that I've cried my love to sleep

Don't wake it up don't wake it up yeah


I've cried my love to sleep
Don't wake it up ooh don't wake it up

Yeah I just cried my love to sleep
Don't wake it up please don't wake it upI saw my love walking down the aisle
And as he passed me by
He turned and gave me a smile
Then the preacher then the preacher
The preacher joined their hands
And all the people all the people began to stand
When I shouted you know it should have been me

You are leaving me stranded
You know that it should have been me baby
Oh baby gettin' ready to marry you
Darlin' darlin' darlin'
You made a promise that we would never part
Then you turned around and broke my little heart
Now you're standing there saying I do
Holding hands with somebody new
You know that it should have been me

Instead of her standing by you
You know that it should have been me
It should have been me

Then the preacher oh yeah the preacher asked
That there be silence please
If anybody objects to this wedding
Speak now or forever or forever hold your peace
Thin I shouted It should have been me
You know that it should have been me
Don't you know that it should have been me
You know that it should have been me
I've been faithful to you baby baby baby
You were leaving me strandedYou promised me
Things that meant a lot
Said so much you
Just up and forgot
What you said
To me about me
You said I was your strength
The air you breathe
So help me honey
You're all I need to
Make my life complete
Oh yes you did
So then

And not the one
You leave behind

Make her the woman
You go home to
With a smile
I fix your evening meals
Iron your clothes

It's all a part of loving you

Stand by your side
Through thick and thin
Not laying awake to
Ask where you been
Cause you'd tell me
If you wanted to

Prepaid calling cards ain't got no time
The love got plenty reason but no rhyme
You can't tell me that it don't mean a thing
When I look into my eyes anything
Can't you see the common ground
You know how I long to be down
It's not a phase that I'm going through
I'm living to see your smile oh Lord I'm loving you
From over 3000 miles away and if you were on Saturn
I'd try to take a rocketship just to see you baby you're the bomb
Take a rocketship just to see you baby you're the one
It seems as if I'm galaxies away
But I'll take a trip to where you stay
And love will be the vessel that I need
No more that a two seated ride
So baby won't you please come occupy my life
I waited all my life
Oh baby for someone like you to come my way
All I can say is
I'm living to see your smile oh Lord I'm loving you
From over 3000 miles away and if you were on Saturn
I'd try to take a rocketship just to see you baby you're the bomb
Take a rocketship just to see you baby you're the one
Take a rocketship just to see you baby you're the one
Take a rocketship just to see you baby you're the one
Take a rocketship just to see you baby you're the one
Take a rocketship just to see you baby you're the one
Rocketship just to see you baby you're the one
You're the oneI swear I feel the spirit every time you I look at you
Cause I know that God is moving in my life
There's a certain type of healing every time you look at me
And I know the feelings neither wrong nor right
It's very evident that you are heaven sent
It's very evident
It's very evident that you are heaven sent
It's very evident
Looking at the sun is like looking at your face
It blinds me sometimes
Laying on your chest is like being in the council of the angel my God
It's very evident that you are heaven sent
It's very evident
It's very evident that you are heaven sent
It's very evident
Repeat
I'm riding with an angel on a wave of love
I'm riding so high riding with an angel
It's very evident that you are heaven sent
It's very evident

But who are we to give up on anyone
And he that is without sin first cast the stone
Judge not lest ye be judged with the same judgment

Greedy survive and survival of the fittest is your alibi

Cause you might want my private for souvenir
And you call me a savage uncivilized
When its you who made lynching a way of life
And you don't want me to be mad
Well I say to you too bad
I'm a product of my environment
So who the fuck we callin' wildlife

I'm pleasantly plump a phat dime
Black as night and a bright night
As you can see I am beautiful me
I was born by the river the day after the tenth
And its hard to deliver Scorpio energy's so intense
Makes me wanna hollar now I know what Marvin meant
The industry's so cold give me the things to my ancestors you owe so

Got a moon above me but no one's here to love me
Lover man oh where can you be
I've heard it said that the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
And I'll go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love love to me strange as it seems
Someday we'll meet and you'll dry all my tears
And whisper sweet little things in my ear
Hugging and akissing oh what I've been missing baby
Lover man oh where can you be

Could be like a heavenly dream

Then whisper sweet little things in my ear
Hugging and akissing oh what I've been missing
Lover man oh where can you be
Lover man oh where can you beI'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe the park across the way
The children's carousel the chestnut trees the wishing well
I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing youThe very thought of you
And I forget to do
The little ordinary things everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a queen
But foolish though it may seem to me that's everything
The mere idea of you
The longing here for you
You never know how slow the moments go
Oh until I'm near here to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in the stars above
Its just the thought of you
The very thought of you my love
It's just the thought of you babe
The very thought of you my loveDozens of guys would storm up
I had to lock my door
Somehow I couldn't warm up
To one before
What was it that controlled me
What kept my lovelife lean
My intuition told me
You'd come on the scene
Baby listen to the rhythm of my heartbeat
And you'll get just what I mean
Embrace me

When the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a man who might have loved me
And I never knew
You know I've always
I've always been a dreamer
Spent my life running 'round
And it's so hard to change
Can't seem to settle down
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same same
So put me on a highway
And show show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time
You can spend all your time spend all your time making money
Oh and you can spend all spend all your love making time
But if it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still would you still be mine
And when you're looking
When you're looking for your freedom
Nobody seems to care
You can't find the door
Can't find it anywhere
When there's nothing
Nothing to believe in
Still you're running back
You keep coming back
You're running back for more
Put me on a highway
And show me show me a sign
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh no
Oh oh
Take it to limit one more timeI don't want you to be no slave
I don't want to work all day
But I want you to be true
And I just wanna make love to you
Love to you
Oohooh
Love to you
All I want to do is wash your clothes
I don't want to keep you indoors
There is nothing for you to do
But keep me making love to you
Love to you
Oohooh
Love to you

And I can tell by the way
That you walk that walk
I can hear by the way
You talk that talk
And I can know by the way
You treat your girl
That I could give you all the loving
In the whole wide world
All I want to do is bake your bread
Just to make sure you're well fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just wanna make love to you

All I want to do is bake your bread
Just to make sure you're well fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just wanna make love to you
Love to you
Oohooh
Love to you
Oohooh
Love to youIf I can see it and that's when I'm like about anything
If I can see it I can do it
I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
If I can see it then I can do it
If I just believe it there's nothing to it
I believe I could fly
I believe I can touch the sky
Think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence it can seem so loud

Last night I needed a man so bad I couldn't sleep at all
I couldn't hardly wait for it to be morning
Then the kids would go to school
Then I'd roll over in bed and play a little game
If you had to have one man just one man in your life who would it be
No it wouldn't be the first one
And he was so surprised to find out that I
That I had never been before
And I wouldn't take Mr Big Shot either
Huh have another drink girl
But the one that I would wanna keep
I know who that would be
The one who first took me during my time that I was hurting
No I said we gotta wait
But he touched me oh so gentle
Oh so gentle
He just relaxed me on
Now she's flowing he said
Beautiful beautiful river
Beautiful beautiful woman river
And I love him for that
Nobody could ever tell me anything bad about that man

Deep in the night
I remember
There I am reaching for you
Wanting to turn to you
That's all I want
Oh so much
Deep in the night I need you
To touch me
Deep in the night
I wait for daylight
But daytime always gets blue
But when the sun
Goes down
That's when I feel cold
And old
Deep in the night I need you
To hold me
I read a book and I think about you
I put it down and I think about you
Make some coffee and I think about you
Watched at the cup and I think about you
Wind the clock and I think about you
Go to work and I think about you
I watch my pillow
And I think
Yeah I think about youDidn't I make you feel like you were the only man
Didn't I give you everything that a woman possibly can
Oh but the longer love I give you it's never enough
And I'm gonna show you baby that a woman can be tough
So come on come on come on come on
And take it take another little piece of my heart now baby
Break it break another little piece of my heart now honey
Honey have another little piece of my heart now baby
You know you've got it if it makes you feel good

You're out on the street looking good
Oh you know you deep down in your heart that it ain't right
You never ever hear me you never hear me when I when I cry at night
Oh but each time I tell myself I just can't stand the pain

But when you hold me in your arms I've seen 
Again and again and again
Come on come on come on come on
Take it take another little piece of my heart now baby
Break it break another little bit of my heart now honey
Honey have another little piece of my heart now baby

Break it break another little piece of my heart now honey
Honey have another little piece of my heart now baby
You know you've got it if it makes you feel goodLook at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty holding your hand
Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near
You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you
On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty and too much in loveMy man is a watch dog
My man is a watch dog yeah
I don't want no watch dog I want a man uhhuh
I don't want no watch dog I want a man right now
I don't want no man of mine
Everywhere I go now he's aright behind
I don't want no watch dog I want a man
Every time I visit my girlfriend's house
He sends his baby brother to check me out
I go outside to sweep in my front yard
He stands over me like a prison guard
I've never seen a man sneaking and ahiding
when he should be out working and providing
He's a watch dog
Yeah he's a watch dogThere's a saying old says that love is blind
Still we're often told seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me where is the shepherd for this lost lamb
There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone to watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me
Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead oh how I need
Someone to watch over me
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead oh how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over meOoh I gotta see you somehow

I know it's wrong it's wrong needing you this way
But there's no other way I can be with you

Oh my motherinlaw
Oh she worries me so If you've not got cash you won't get far
Money is a measure of who you are
If you've not got money you won't get far
Love is the fuel that drives my car
On four star love I might get far
Love is the seed that drives me on
But it doesn't take long before love goes wrong
Feed me the fuel that drives his car
We've lost the map we've gone too far
Fear I don't know who you are
Who's got my drugs Who's got my car
A vehicle to me is not enough love
If you've not got love then fear's your stuff
Lust be the fuel that drives my car
I'm lost in love I've gone too far
With a winning smile
You can fool the world
With a bit of fame
You'll soon get laid
Power is the source we're looking for
Life only sucks when you're two feet tall
Greed is the source of a restless need
And a restless need is what drives me
I've gone too far
I've gone too far
I've gone too far
I know what you've got
I know what you've got
If you've not got cash you won't get far
Money is a measure of who you areJust because you are riddin high
and doing good for yourself
you want to smile and wave goodbye
and give your love to someone else
uhun
one day just wait and see
youre gonna be hurt just like me
you know you are wrong
but ahead on
I dont think it will be long before she will be gone
and i'm willing to set you free
if you avoid her company
i believe that the
that pulls you 
I said the 
that pulls you 
I believe the same rope that pull you up
sure can hang you
one day she will get tired of you
the way that you got tired of me ohh yeah
you will see what i'm going through
when youre alone and in misery ohh yeah
i hate to say i told you so
so you better think before you go
i think you are such a full
for making such a move
nobody else would do the things i've done for you
and i'm willing to set you free
if you take this this tip from me
i believe that the 
that pulls you 
i said the 
that pulls you 
the same rope that pull you up
sure can hang you
you the we week may same day be strong

never could do nobody wrong
I found out a long time ago
i believe the same rope 
that pulls you 
is gonna hang you
Baby baby baby
You know I love you
And I know you could love me too
But you can't let yourself be unfaithful
You can't let yourself be untrue
If I'm not it would make just a little bit of difference now
I'd gladly get down on my knees yes I would
But I might as well
Make myself face it
I know that you'd never
You never belong to me
That's why it hurts me so much
It hurts me so much
To be unable to look
When you know that you can't touch
The best thing to do
Is to try to be stronger
Push my heart out of the way
I can't let it
It can't go on any longer
The game the game is getting too rough
Too rough to play
That's why it hurts me so much
It hurts me so much
It hurts me so much
It hurts me it hurts me so much
No don't let it hurt me so much
It hurtsIf you keep on playin' around
You gonna lose me oh baby

I'm completely in the dark
When you know that you've just met an angel
Is there a proper remark
We were alone for a moment
Why was I lost in a cloud
Do you speak to an angel in a whisper
Or do you just say I love you out loud
We were alone for a moment
Why was I lost in a cloud
Do you speak to an angel in a whisper
Or do you just say I love you out loudSorrow

I'm so blue
Cause I'm worried over you
I I sometimes wonder
Why I never hear from you
You promised to write me
Each and everyday
And I haven't heard from you
Since you went away
Oohh oohh
I sit by my window pane
Hoping for a letter
One that never came
My heart cries for just
One little line
Anything to say you're mine
Oohh oohh oohh oohh
I said a prayer
Every night hoping
Hoping and praying
Someday someday you'd write
Oohh oohh
My heart cries
For one little line
Anything to say you're mineSomeone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty
Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now
From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love
LoveIt must be your love
Or no love at all
It must be your arms baby
Or no hug at all
I find myself waiting
Each night for your call
Now people say
Go on girl find someone new
But they just don't know
What I've found in you
It must be your love
Or no love at all
It must be your kiss
Or no kiss at all
It's got to be your touch baby
That I love so much
But without your tender love and care
I'm surely gonna fall now
And they keep on tryin' to tell me
To find someone else girl
But oh they just don't know
What I've found in you
It must be your love yeah
Or no love at all
I wouldn't think of living
Oh I wouldn't think of making it
Without you
I don't care what the people say
Oh you got to you got to feel
The same way too
I'm gonna do all the things
I told ya yeah
Promise each day each day
To be true
It got to be your love
Got to got to be your love
Got to be your love
No other love will do
I ain't takin' no other love
I don't want
I not gonna have any love
But your love
Got to beCain slew Abel Seth knew not why
For if the children of Israel suppose to multiply
Why must any of the children die
So he asked the Lord and the Lord said
Man means nothing he means less to me
Than the lowliest cactus flower or the humblest yucca tree
He chases round this desert 'cause he thinks that's where I'll be
That's why I love mankind
I recoil in horror from the foulness of thee
From the squalor and the filth and the misery
How we laugh up here in Heaven prayers you offer me
That's why I love mankind
The Christians and the Jews were having a jamboree
The Buddhists and the Hindus joined on satellite TV
They picked their four greatest priests
And they began to speak
They said Lord the plague is on the world
Lord no man is free
The temples that we built to you have tumbled into the sea
Lord if you won't take care of us
Won't you please please let us be
And the Lord said

Everybody fight about a spoonful
That spoon that spoon that spoonful
It could be a spoonful of water
To save you from the desert sand
But one spoon of love from my forty five
Will save you from another man
Men lie about that spoonful
Some cry about that spoonful
Some die about that spoonful
Everybody fightin' about a spoonful
That spoon that spoon that spoonful
That spoon that spoon that spoonful
It could be a spoonful of sugar
It could be a spoonful of tea
But one little spoon of your precious love

Men lie about that spoonful
Some cry about that spoonful
Some die about that spoonful
Everybody fightin' about a spoonful
That spoon that spoon that spoonful

This never happened before
Though I have prayed for a lifetime
That such as you would suddenly suddenly be mine

And never never never so near
Mine to have when the now
And the here disappear
What matters what matters dear for when
This doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment forever
But never never again
Mine to hold as I'm holding you now
And never never never so near
Mine to have when the now
And the here disappear and oh

When the bottle was empty
And the nights grew cold
In my hour of darkness
In my time of need
You were my angel of mercy
And helped me to believe
You touched my soul
When I was lonely
You held me up
When I couldn't fly
There's no words could explain
How I feel inside
And this I tell you
In a world full of anger
In times gone strange
You held me close
You held me close to you
Lay my head on your shoulder
I finally let it all out
It felt good for a moment
Not living in a shadow of doubt
But everybody needs a little something
To pull them through
I gave one for the other
And God know that the other was you
Now only time will tell
Only time will tell
If our love is scratched in sand
Or if it's etched in stone
Only time will tell
Only time will tell
If our love will stand
Or walk the road alone
My angel of mercy
Pulled me through somehow
I just hope you know
I need you now
You're the one
That touched my very soul
The one who held on tight
God knows you never let go
Now only time will tell
Only time will tell
If our love is scratched in sand
Or if it's etched in stone
Only time will tell
Only time will tell
If our love will stand
Or walk the road alone
Only time will
Only time will

Only time will tell

Only time will
Only time will

Only time will tell

And I hope you're satisfied
You've got me where you want me
And you hardly even tried
One single look was all I took
And then starryeyed
I watched my poor old heart
Go on that rollercoaster ride
I say I won't surrender
But I know darn well I will
My hopes are pretty slender
And my chances almost nil
Why should I try to alibi
Anyone can see
You've got me where you want me
And it's where I wanna be
You've got me where you want me
And I hope you're satisfied
You've got me where you want me
And you never even tried
A single look was all it took
And then starryeyed
I watched my poor heart
Go on that rollercoaster ride
I say I won't surrender
But I know darn well you will
My hopes are pretty slender
And my chances almost nil
Why should I try to alibi
When anyone can see
You've got me where you want me
You've got me where you want me
And it's where I wanna be
And it's where I wanna be
And it's where I wanna beI cant understand
the way that you act
you give me your love
and then you take it all back
i know everyone
is somebody's fool
you broke my heart
and every every rule
now if this is love
that you're giving me
uh uh i don't want it

i don't want it

i've been a fool
in the biggest kind of way
to think that you could ever belong to me
when i know
I'm no closer to your heart
than the sky is
right now
to the sea
oh you come to me
when things go wrong
I'm just a shoulder
for you to cry on
you only want me
only when you need me
all i ever get
is just a little bit of sympathy
now if this is love
that you're giving me
uh uh uh uh i don't want it

i don't want it

life without love

is not what i see

but i cant get a smile

from any stranger on the street

oh love

don't want it don't want it
I can do what I want
I'm in complete control
That's what I tell myself
I gotta a mind of my own
I'll be alright alone
Don't need anybody else
I gave myself a good talking to
No more bein' a fool for you
But I see ya
And all I remember
How you make me want to surrender
Damn your eyes
For taking my breath away
Makin' me want to stay
Damn your eyes
For gettin' my hopes up high
Making me fall in love again
Damn your eyes
It's always the same
You say that you'll change
Somehow you never do
I believe all your lies
The look in your eyes
You make it all seem true
I guess I see what I want to see
Or is it my heart just deceivin' me
Because with that look I know so well
I fall completely under your spell
Damn your eyes
For takin' my breath away
For makin' me want to stay
Damn your eyes
For gettin' my hopes up high
For makin' me fall in love again
Damn your eyes
You keep deliberately deceivin' me
Makin' me see what I want to see
Damn your eyes
For takin' my breath away hey
For makin' me want to stay
Damn your eyes
For getting'my hopes up high
For making me fall in love again
Damn your eyes
Damn your eyes
For taking my breath away
Damn damn your eyes
For getting my hopes up high
For making me fall in love
Fall in love again
Damn damn your eyesLying 'round home alone
On a rainy night like this
Starving for your love
Hungry for just one kiss
Every raindrop I hear
Against my window pane
Speaks so loud and clear
Oh Lord spells out your name
Got nowhere to turn tired of being alone
Feel like breakin' up somebody's home
I know it's useless
Hanging on when you belong to someone else
Can't control the feelin'
'Cause after all I didn't make myself
Last night I cried so hard
I believe I caught a chill
Can't stand the vibration
And oh my heart just won't stand still
Got nowhere to turn tired of being alone
Feel like breakin' up somebody's home
Got nowhere to turn tired of being alone
Feel like breakin' up somebody's home
I know it's useless
Hanging on when you belong to someone else
Can't control my feelin'
'Cause after all I didn't make myself
Got nowhere to turn tired of being alone
Feel like breakin' up somebody's home
Got nowhere to turn tired of being alone
Feel like breakin' up somebody's home
Got nowhere to turn tired of being alone
Feel like smashin' up somebody's home
Feel like breakin' up somebody's homeVery timid when you know it's all wrong
You don't want it to be long
I tell you the best way to keep it out of the wind
Trust in no one not even your closest friend
But if your teeth will bite your tongue
Can't you see where it's coming from
When you do your thing
Don't let other people peep in your hand
It ain't always what you do
It's who you let see you do it
It ain't always what you do
It's who you let see you do it
All my life I've been taught
That you ain't wrong until you get caught
There's an old saying
And I believe that it's true
You shouldn't let your right hand now
What your left hand is going to do
But if your teeth will bite your tongue
Can't you see where it's coming from
When you do your thing
Don't let other people peep your hand
It ain't always what you do
It's who you let see you do it
It ain't always what you do
It's who you let see you do it
Ain't that right ain't that right
Ain't that right ain't that right
But if your teeth will bite your tongue
Can't you see where it's coming from
When you do your thing
Don't let other people peep your hand
Peep your hand
It ain't always what you do
It's who you let see you do it
It ain't always what you do
It's who you let see you do it
Ain't that right ain't that right
Ain't that right ain't that right
Ain't that right ain't that right
Ain't that right ain't that rightIf the sun goes behind a cloud
And you feel its gonna rain
If the moon ain't shinin' bright
And the stars the stars won't shine for you tonight

Years full of tears and regret
I've been alone broken hearted
Trying so hard to forget
Girl of my dreams I love you honest I do
You are so sweet
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms
Then life would be complete
Since you've been gone dear life don't seem the same
Please come back again
And after all's said and done there's only one
Girl of my dreams it's you
It's strange how life deals you sorrow
Sunshine and joy always nigh
We live and learn for tomorrow
But sometimes the learning comes high
Girl of my dreams I love you honest I do
You are so sweet
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms
Then life would be complete
Since you've been gone dear life don't seem the same
Please come back again
And after all's said and done there's only one
Girl of my dreams it's youI was lost in the world of dreams
Hunting every star shining over him it seems
I watch like a shepherd boy
Searching for his laughing and dancing everywhere
You can walk yeah you catching me
You and I are joy oh yes you set me free
We kiss and the world was our club
And my heart cried oh I love you so
Then my heart cried oh I love you so
Then my heart cried oh I love you so
Love you so

How it all got started how it all begin
God made the heavens God made the earth
Made a man and a woman out of blood sweat and dirt
And He looked around the neighborhood
And He said to His self This is good
God made the rivers and the mountains with his hands
God made the wind to blow the shifting sands
He put the fishes in the in the deep blue sea
Filled up the garden with flowers and the trees
And God looked around the neighborhood
And He said to His self This is good
But the devil he was jealous took the apple in his hand
The devil tempted woman and woman tempted man
God He mourned and the tears rolled down His face
It broke His heart to see His children fall from grace
And on the seventh day they say God rested
But you know that ain't the truth
Cause on the seventh day God made the blue
Cause on the seventh day God made the blue
The blues is been around ever since that day
Everybody gets the blues everybody got to pay
For the wicked things we do
And what we put each other through
And on the seventh day they say God rested
But you know that ain't the truth
Cause on the seventh day God made the blue

2xAs I lay me down too sleep
I pray to lord my soul too keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray to lord my soul to take
My cup full I'm laid back I'm bout mine you know that
I'm rag racing zoom zoom in a rush too get all that
Cross my heart I die hard come through your hood in all black
If you real you'd recognize
All I do is grind and pray riding through the streets all day
All I do is grind and pray riding through these streets all day
They don't ever see you like I do
First thing when you wake up before you put on your make up
And they don't really know you like I do
'Cause me and you ain't the same you ain't gotta run no game
Girl cause what you do and what I do ain't different
We both on a mission I love your ambition
And I know how it is to hit the block and get the gwop
And you know what it is to hit the stage and make it pop
Like damm I hope somebody spent some money today
And I pray nobody try to come and take it away
'Cause I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
'Cause all these fucking bills are due
And I see all this money too make so girl you know
I ain't judging you go and get your money
Go and get your money go and get your money
Baby I salute go and get your money
Go and get your money go and get your money
Take that money girl it's yours
Spend that money girl it's yours
You work hard for it it's yours
Work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you go and get your money
Go and get your money go and get your money
Single mother in college working hard for them dollars
Girl we got something in common making money with ballers
See you pussy popping at Onyx keep it clapping at Magic
Got them niggas tricking at Palace
Come on making this happen
Girl I love seeing your back bend they cashing out
And you cash in they going broke and you working
Back broke when you twerking
I know how hard this shit can be when income is uncertain
Hustling just too make a way know you're thinking damn I hope
Somebody spent some money today
And I pray nobody try to come and take it away
'Cause I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
'Cause all these fucking bills are due
And I see all this money too make so girl you know
I ain't judging you go and get your money
Go and get your money go and get your money
Baby I salute go and get your money

That money girl it's yours

You work hard for it it's yours
Work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you go and get your money
Go and get your money go and get your money
We grind together we shine together
Show the single folks how to double
Two wrongs don't make it right
But two strong's make a power couple
And our trouble is small talkers
Talking down on the big spenders
But the winners focus on the win
And sore losers focus on the winners
Stacked up shawty stacked up shawty
And if I ever need it she the back up for me
Blacked up foree his and hers 'cedes
No hoes to the house just the first lady
So gon' get your money don't let nobody stop that
Even if you gotta pop that 
We do it big an no together we about to do it bigger
My little mama hustle harder than a lot of these niggas
I ain't judging you go and get your money
Go and get your money go and get your money
Baby I salute go and get your money
Go and get your money go and get your money
Make that money girl it's yours
Spend that money girl it's yours
You work hard for it it's yours
Work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you go and get your money
Go and get your money go and get your moneyWord got around that a nigga got shot
Heard a nigga drew down' and he bucked so his ass got popped
We was on my block trying to move these rocks
Trying to stack this cash on the low gotta duck these cops
We was off third and polock chilling in the back of the tracks
Niggas got packs trying to get them racks
X5 I was riding in the back with the brother's' round kicking in the gat in my lap
17 had no dreams drinking four loco's Sprite and codeine
First class I was so lean said fuck highschool so I left Reed
No one told me life would be this way
I swear nobody told me
Guess this is the game we chose to play
Crazy how it's always been the same
People dying every day that ain't nothing new
When you from downtown downtown
Out here tryna make a way
I won't let these niggas take me downdown down
Riding on these niggas I be riding I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas I be riding I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas I be riding I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas I be riding I be riding on 'em
Phone just rang heard a nigga got got
He was over in the East last thing that he heard six shots
He ain't gettin' no love from the cops nobody got caught
Real talk when I heard who it was heart damn near stopped
Somebody done killed my brother now I gotta get back
Let em know cause a nigga gotta feel that
Sitting shotgun with the shot gun
When you hear the shots come nigga don't run
Already bad it can only get worse
Hand full of steel cause the shit still hurts
Cut so deep when they put him in the hearse
Never saw 25 had to put him in the dirt
No one told me life would be this way
I swear nobody told me
Guess this is the game we chose to play
Crazy how it's always been the same
People dying every day that ain't nothing new
When you from downtown downtown
Out here tryna make a way
I won't let these niggas take me downdown down
Riding on these niggas I be riding I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas I be riding I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas I be riding I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas I be riding I be riding on 'em
Once upon a time down town in a nine 
Where they don't mind dying
Sworn to a life of crime was a youngin' that only stood 5'5
Big money on his mind clothes ain't wrinkled while his hands on his iron
Shot six times right in front of my mom
Kind of 32 man I'm lucky to survive
On that Pac juice real niggas don't die
Bitch I'm from Atown slang crack on the same set
Blood stains there from a homie with his head cracked
O'Gs like A' wacks they'll be doing this shit way back since A track
And we yell where the gang at
You can get fame there from the way you're going to bang that
Shoot for the head watch how you aim that
Price on your head and we gonna take that
It's about to go down you ain't about this then you better go now
Sun going down keep it going down
Everybody lay down ski mask down
All you gonna see is my eyes and my frown
Last thing you hear is my gun going pow
It happens every day round my way
This ain't nothing new you grew up downtown
People dying every day that ain't nothing new
When you from downtown downtown
I'm just trying to make a way
I won't let these niggas take me downdown down
Riding on these niggas I be riding I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas I be riding I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas I be riding I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas I be riding I be riding on 'emRain down girl

Keep rocking and drip dropping we ain't stoppin' till you get through
Gimme all your precipitation

But I won't be evacuating
And I think it's ironic

A survivor hope you know I need it all
Hard headed I come up on that G shit
But when it comes to that G spot
It's no secret that I can make you

Until we hear the siren sound
We got the bedroom burnin downShe was only 17 when she left home heading of to college
Just the clothes on the back 40 dollars in the pocket
On the couch of a one bedroom apartment
Roommate trynna get her to pop her pussy for dollars
He was only 13 just a lookout on the corner
He started of small couple pills and marihuana
Now he's thinking he should go out on the block
And see if he can get shit poppin'
He was tired of going in for just a little bit of profit
She fell in love with the ballers and bottles
He fell in love with the block and the Glock
Now he totin the choppers
Why does it seem like nobody want to be lawyers or doctors
Now a days everybody out there trynna be dealers and models
Just a thought
I guess that's how it goes
When it's all you know
And you ain't a dreamer
And you ain't a dreamer
I guess that's how it be
When it's all you see
And you ain't a dreamer
And you ain't a dreamer
Now you can find her on a Wednesday
Trickin' and twerking and working so hard for them singles
24 how to get naked
Money she see for the takin'
She gonna take it
Been dancing so long she don't now when she'll be graduatin'
Friends trynna tell her she trippin'
She telling them to stop hatin'
3 years later for he grows into a men
Got a pocket full of money 9mili in his hand
Momma prayin' tryin' make him understand
That they just wanna put him in the system
It's to late now he convicted
She fell in love with the ballers and bottles
He fell in love with the block and the Glock
Now he totin the choppers
Why does it seem like nobody want to be lawyers or doctors
Now a days everybody out there trynna be dealers and models
Just a thought
I guess that's how it goes
When it's all you know
And you ain't a dreamer
And you ain't a dreamer
I guess that's how it be
When it's all you see
And you ain't a dreamer
And you ain't a dreamer
She never dreamt about going to college
Choosing her major
Getting some knowledge
He never dreamt about living for something
All that he knew was he was tired of the struggle
She never knew that
She'd ever do that
Now she addicted to the money and the new bags
And now he wish that
He could get back
All the time he lost
Now he pays the cost
She fell in love with the ballers and bottles
He fell in love with the block and the Glock
Now he totin the choppers
Why does it seem like nobody want to be lawyers or doctors
Now a days everybody out there trynna be dealers and models
Just a thought
I guess that's how it goes
When it's all you know
And you ain't a dreamer
And you ain't a dreamer
I guess that's how it be
When it's all you see
And you ain't a dreamer
And you ain't a dreamerI don't really know
I mean shit that's usually my everyday
Why am I always thinking
What am I this thing called life is just a bitch
Sometimes I talk to myself talk to myself a little too much
Who is God a nigga just be trying to figure it out
I'm always thinking my brain always gone in a blank is God my friend or does God love me
I got to do better
Niggas say when you come up I got to do more money changes everything
No fuck that no it don't
More money more mother fucking problems who put me here
What's with this shit about we supposed to survive right
Where do I go next what's next that's something to think about
What's this shit really about how did I even get here
Why you don't wanna see a nigga eat
 is that the police
I be damned if a nigga kill me you win some you lose some
Who is policing the police 
What mark am I going to leave here on this earth
Why are you mad can you answer
What the fuck you mad
What is life what is this
Do you know
What is this thing called lifeEvery day that I'm alive I try to life it to the fullest
Keep my pistol and believe me I'll pull it
If a nigga tryna kill me I know what I gotta do
Hope somebody feel me 'cause you know that I done seen a lot
Just a young nigga grinding for the block tryna reach the top
Being broke would turn the bitches off now they pussy pop
Tryna get the cash I got now found love
'Cause all these bitches ass got shots and they so proud
But I ain't judging if you thought I was I wasn't
'Cause I don't wanna hit it once and I ain't cuffing
Young wild niggas on here can't tell me nothing
'Cause I remember when a nigga ain't had nothing
Now I came up I got a lil something tryna turn a lil bit to a lot
Like when lovers turning cocaine to pot
I went through the soda straight out the box
Hoping when this shit drop it will rock hoping when my shit drop it will rock
'Cause ain't shit changed even since my nigga Pac got banged
Some of the players switched up and it's the same old game
I see no change so I guess I gotta be that change
I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
Showing young niggas how to make it through
'Cause I had to get it out the muscle I can never loose the hustle
'Cause I represent the struggle a change
Guess now you can see there's a better way
So when we there we'll make it to a better place
Guess it's looking like this shit will change
I'm hoping I can be that change
We could be that change
We could be that change
We could be that change
Make the whole world change
We could be that change
We could be that change
We could be that change
So many people outchea with nowhere to go
Mother's loosing their children for reasons nobody know
Places with no suns and nothing can grow
And people in poverty wishing they could be more
Making brand new kicks can make you rich
I rather be in brand new whips than pay our rent
Single momma's got 4 kids the income's fixed
Baby daddy's out on bond still ain't shit
Never took the time to notice
The person in the reflection is the real focus
If we could change with them then I'll notice
Historically ain't nobody looking out for us
all they ever had was doubt for us
Cause ain't shit changed even since my nigga Pac got banged
Some of the players switched up and it's the same old game
I see no change so I guess I gotta be that change
Yeah I'm guilty of daydreamin'
That I could change the world
You can laugh all you want
But you can't blame a man for dreamin'
And I seen so many people life go downhill because they
Gave up they stopped believin'
They just stopped dreamin'Right there right there right there
Right there right there right there
Right there right there right there
Right there right there right there
I know how it be when you trying your best
But you turn around and you got nothing to show for it
So you stay on your grind tryna get to the shine
Even turn to crime but how come I ain't made it yet
I'm just like you  I been there too
I hope you feel me cause I been through the pain
There ain't a difference you and I are the same

I remember nights there when I had to go to sleep in the back of the Quick  Easy
Chilling on the boulevard with them hardheaded niggas from the 7th ward
Had a chick in the Ville who was down for a nigga that's real
Use to have fam in the Florida projects

Girl listen close I'm 'bout to learn you something
I ain't never been one to catch feelings I come and I go as I please
Not sayin' I'm pimpin' forever for now this is how it's gon' be
Just tryna stay in the moment and chasing this paper I'm focused
But if you ain't with it then clear it the look in your eyes say you open

So girl if you with it stop playing and get it save all that talking you ready to live it

So promise me you'll take your timeLords knows I work hard
But I still gotta stay on my job
'Cause I ain't tryna get laid off
Won't stop until the day that I'm a boss
I know somebody tired of assisted living
Waking every morning saying I gotta get it
Focus on the paper can give you tunnel vision
Drug dealing stacking flipping just tryna make a living
Baby shaking on the pole just to make tuition
Single mommas facing drama so they can feed they children
Niggas strung out on that dope just cause they had a taste
And niggas dropping out of school on the paper chase
Who am I to hate I ain't judging 'cause I can relate
Skipping school getting high just tryna motivate
Tryna make it 'til I make it to them pearly gates
Lost so many of my homies can't face another wake
Another lost another cop another mistake
Nothing standing in my way
I went through a hurricane of pain and I'm standing today
And if you outchea on your grind fuck whoever hate
Just pay attention and concentrate
Yeah niggas it's crunch time
And I'm just tryna eat just like a kid at lunch time
And if you thought it was joke it ain't no punchline
Ain't nothing standing in my way I'm 'bout to get mine it's hard work
Lords knows I work hard
But I still gotta stay on my job
'Cause I ain't tryna get laid off
Won't stop 'til the day that I'm a boss yo it's hard work
Lords knows I work hard
But I still got to stay on my job
And I ain't taking no days off
Won't stop 'til the day it pays off it's hard work yeah
Yeah I'm speaking real so you gon' believe me
First of all nobody said that it was gon' be easy
And you don't see the pain you just see what's on the TV
When you don't let them keep the change then they call you greedy
Now they on social media talking greezy
Would get the guns but my sons and my daughters need me
I get it off soon as it comes make your order speedy
I'm on a hell of a run I thank the Lord completely
I'm putting overtime in so I'm sorta sleepy
And I haven't slept in years so that's sorta creepy
Gotta beat me fair and square but you ain't gonna cheat me
Carry the weight of the world on my shoulders weekly
Blame the universe that's how the stars work
Yeah play your hand that's how the cards work nah
Nah ain't nothing planned this is God's work
We working hard 'cause it's hard work
Yeah niggas it's crunch time
And I'm just tryna eat just like a kid at lunch time
And if you thought it was joke it ain't no punchline
Ain't nothing standing in my way I'm 'bout to get mine it's hard work
Lords knows I work hard
But I still gotta stay on my job
'Cause I ain't tryna get laid off
Won't stop 'til the day that I'm a boss yo it's hard work
Lords knows I work hard
But I still got to stay on my job
And I ain't taking no days off
Won't stop 'til the day it pays off it's hard work yeah
It's hard work yeah
It's hard it's hard work yeah
It's hard work yeah
It's hard it's hard work yeahSometimes I get emotional
When I can't seem to find the way I'm supposed to go
And all these socalled people that I'm supposed to know
They be the main ones
Smile up in your face but behind your back they hate
So I hope you know
You're like the only reason I'm emotional
My tears fall like water so that I can grow
Not like I was before
Tryna make a change I need something more
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
So I'mma let the song cry
I'mma let my soul cry through these words
I need to try to free my mind
Sometimes I need to cry just to ease my hurt
But when I let the song cry
Hope you don't think I still won't ride for mine
Every rose needs the rain sometimes
But know that you can dry your eyes this time
Let the song cry
What am I supposed to do
Hold it all together when I think of you
In my heart I'm thinking you were gone too soon
May you rest in peace yet I can't sleep
It's my point of view
Got me in a state of mind I'm so confused
Crying raindrops so that I can bloom
So what am I to do
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
So I'mma let the song cry
I'mma let my soul cry through these words
I need to try to free my mind
Sometimes I need to cry just to ease my hurt
But when I let the song cry
Hope you don't think I still won't ride for mine
Every rose needs the rain sometimes
But know that you can dry your eyes this time
Let the song cry




I may be cryin' now but I'll be laughin' later
No way wouldn't be easy when you're tryna be the greatest
That ever did it or does it
Ain't no fuckin' time for later
And I know they think I'm sporadic
The bastard child of an addict
But I'm way too calculated
I try to love but I never knew her
This money I'm blowin' through it
Ain't rockin' red or blue I'm unaffiliated
'Cause my bloods and my cousins hate me
I try to buy my mama's love no she don't appreciate it
So I stay inebriated
I figured maybe J Cole or Drizzy Drake
Would drop a verse and tell the people how we hurtin'
Guess I was mistaken
This moment mine for the taking
For all them nights I thought of suicide contemplating
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
So I'mma let the song cry
I'mma let my soul cry through these words
I need to try to free my mind
Sometimes I need to cry just to ease my hurt
But when I let the song cry
Hope you don't think I still won't ride for mine
Every rose needs the rain sometimes
But know that you can dry your eyes this time
Let the song cryI came from drop tops and old school Chevy's
Dope boys rollin' through shittin' on ya heavy
Fifteens in the trunk beatin' down your block
Only 4 years old when Biggie got shot
I remember playing on the block hanging on the block
Young niggas slanging on the block getting off them rocks
Now we livin' better now Coogi sweater now
Weather still getting colder we could change the weather now
But I
Came up in criminal days
Living these criminal ways what can I say
Hugging the block every day
Grindin' and making a way and then I pray
For better days that it don't be the same tomorrow
Now I celebrate my sorrows with this bottle
And say

I pray for more better days

I know that I can feel change

I know that I can feel change
Everyday ain't good but everyday ain't bad
Mama always said show thanks for what you have
Boy never forget to realize you're blessed
This cold world can rot you if you let it
Now I'm out here tryna get it really out here tryna get it
Always knew that I would make it maybe it was so prophetic
'Cause I came from the bottom and the humbleness beginnings
From the youngest nigga grindin' to the youngest nigga wining
Came up in criminal days
Living these criminal ways what can I say
Hugging the block every day
Grindin' and making a way and then I pray
For better days that it don't be the same tomorrow
Now I celebrate my sorrows with this bottle
And say

I pray for more better days

I know that I can feel change

I pray for more better days

I know that I can feel change
Before you die you make your mark and reach new levels
Want the bread want the diamonds and the bezels
And if these bitches that you want have several
Just gotta know lotta shit's temporary
It won't last no no it won't last no
Meaning it til' here
Next thing you know it's all gone
That's why I been on my grizzy outchea
Long as I grind better days are near
Came up in criminal days
Living these criminal ways what can I say
Hugging the block every day
Grindin' and making a way and then I pray
For better days that it don't be the same tomorrow
Now I celebrate my sorrows with this bottle
And say

I pray for more better days

I know that I can feel change

I pray for more better days

I know that I can feel changeI've been around I've been around the world

Girl I'mma put it down you know I've been around

Soon as I got something started niggas act like I owe them something
But nigga I don't owe you shit you say I do fuck you and who you with
I fought for everything I got and a nigga don't brag 'bout what he have
But I work hard to have a lot 'cause I can't go back to when times got bad
Them hard nights and my hard life is what keep me motivated
But I feel so misunderstood 'cause anytime shit go good
They say I'm Hollywood
'Cause a young nigga living good

And it starts to come from familiar faces they pray on my fall

Usually when people feel they make it
It seems so easy to go and get complacent
But I'm up right now tryna make a million bucks right now

When you see I'm doing good
When you see I'm doing good
Nigga you see I'm doing goodAs the days go by
I remember we was sitting on the aisle
Wish I could take it back to the days we lost
But it's easier said then done someone had to pay the cost
I know nothing lasts forever no nothing at all
Sometimes you don't ever get up after you fall
Every day's a gamble
I know you can't win 'em all
But that don't stop the hurt at all
One time for my fallen soldiers that were lost in war
Two times for my gangstas who ain't here with us no more
Three times for them fathers that ain't tryna do for they kids
Never thought that missing you would ever feel like this
I hope I see you on the other side
So we can kick it like we did before
I hope you leave a little room on the other side
So I know I got somewhere that I can go
I hope I'm not banging at the door saying let me in
And I pray that I'm forgiven for my sins
And I see you on the other side
Hope I see you on the other side
Real niggas don't cry 'til I seen real niggas who died
I ain't gon' lie I had real tears in these eyes
Made me feel something inside seem like I'm gon' lose myself
If I knew somebody else I'm gon' need somebody else
One time for my fallen soldiers that were lost in war
Two times for my gangstas who ain't here with us no more
Three times for them fathers that ain't tryna do for they kids
Never thought that missing you would ever feel like this
I hope I see you on the other side
So we can kick it like we did before
I hope you leave a little room on the other side
So I know I got somewhere that I can go
I hope I'm not banging at the door saying let me in
And I pray that I'm forgiven for my sins
And I see you on the other side
Hope I see you on the other side
Remember all the good times we had
It's so sad 'cause we can't go back
Now all we got are old times throwbacks
Know you stay forever on my mind see you on the other side
Remember all the good times we had
It's so sad 'cause we can't go back

And I see you on the other side
Hope I see you on the other sideBaby I don't blame you
For being in the club
Getting all that love
'Cause your so beautiful
God made you to show that off
Now I ain't ever been the jealous type of guy
But I want you to myself I can't lie
I know we ain't on no one on one thing
But baby it should change
'Cause when I be out with other chicks I be thinking 'bout you
And when you be out on dates you be texting me too
Telling me to come pick you up when he drop you off
I pray to God he ain't breaking you off
I don't want nobody but you
Kissin' on my tattoos
I don't want nobody but me
Talkin' to you
Until you fall asleep
We better stop playing 
Before we mess around and someone gets hurt
I don't want nobody but you 
Kissin' on my tattoos
Nobody but you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
Nobody but you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
Nobody but you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
Nobody but you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
All my homies wanna know what's up with us
They can't believe that I'm kicking it with just one girl
But I'm cool with that
Them pretty eyes and that smile
Girl I'm a fool for that 
'Cause when I be out with other chicks I be thinking 'bout you
And when you be out on dates you be texting me too
Telling me to come pick you up when he drop you off
I pray to God he ain't breaking you off
I don't want nobody but you
Kissin' on my tattoos
I don't want nobody but me
Talkin' to you
Until you fall asleep

Nobody but you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
Nobody but you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on meNot a day goes by I don't think to myself
And remember the times there was no one else
I felt so alone there was pain that I felt
'Cause even self made niggas don't wanna do it by themselves
I looked to the hills someone's coming for help
And he gave me the will when there was nothing left
Lord knows that I cried Lord knows that I cried
Those nights I couldn't eat had to swallow my pride
But through it all one thing remained
I kept it real I stayed the same
And I made it through a lot of pain
Had a lot of sleepless nights but still I have to fight
So I went and got it out the dirt
When they told me it would never work
And the bad just kept on getting worse
Had to tell myself a few words from the heart
Look at how far I've come and I'm here y'all
If you think nobody feels you best believe I know
Look I can't turn back now when they've killed y'all
And I can't pay all these bills y'all better know one thing for sure
Look at how far I've come even though I'm outchea stressing
Still I gotta do my best and let it go
So I know I can't look back now
I gotta keep pressing on 'til I make it somehow
I know some days you feel like giving up
Feel like time is running out and all you have is doubt
Tryna keep your head up but you fed up tryna stack your bread up
Like how come the outcome of my income isn't dough comin'
No one is helpin' they just out for theyself
Outchea tryna make a way hoping there's a better day
And when you think that you're done
And the storm is raging
Look through the clouds and you can see the sun
Sometimes I know it's hard and life can have you stressing
But you should count your blessings and every single lesson you've learned
It takes hard work in getting it out the dirt
But how could you know pleasure if you never knew hurt
We all go through our share of pain ups and downs
For reasons that I can't explain
But when it's all said and done
And you think you've run as far as you can run
Look at how far I've come and I'm here y'all
If you think nobody feels you best believe I know
Look I can't turn back now when they've killed y'all
And I can't pay all these bills y'all better know one thing for sure
Look at how far I've come even though I'm outchea stressing
Still I gotta do my best and let it go
So I know I can't look back now
I gotta keep pressing on 'til I make it somehowOne minute I'll be on one next minute I'll be chillin'
Sometimes I really care sometimes I really don't
And you'll be all up in your feelings
Sometimes I wanna be solo
Sometimes I feel like something missin'
Sometimes I be like damn you could be the one
If you keep playin' your position and you be playin' your position like a pro
Like the way you know if you really got the good I'll never let you go
And you always look good you be going with the flow
Keep on doing what you doing baby that will get you chose
I suppose who knows
Depends on how I be feeling using what my heart's revealing
Maybe you got what I'm missin' would you keep it real and
My heart belong to you baby would you act right
Could you be the one on my side or would you run and hide
If I gave my all to you baby would you play your part if I gave you my heart
Would you know what to do with it
Would you know what to do
Would you know what to do baby if it was you
Would you know what to do
Would you know what to do with it
Would you know what to do
Would you know what to do or would you be confused baby if it were you
Would you stay down for a nigga
Times get bad stick around with a nigga
If I came home late if I had a long day
Would you lay me on the bed go to town on a nigga
Tell the truth baby would you
Be the one I need baby could you take all of me
If I call you are you down to ride if fall down you be by my side
Girl I really wanna know are you puttin' on a show
Is it really you for sure if you not then let it go
Baby I ain't what you want if you puttin' on a front
And you trynna blow a smoke better fire up a blunt
Let it pass me cause I'mma keep it real if you ask me
I'll let you know how I'm feelin' you'll see what my heart's revealing
Maybe you got what I'm missin' would you keep it real and
My heart belong to you baby would you act right
Could you be the one on my side or would you run and hide
If I gave my all to you baby would you play your part if I gave you my heart
Would you know what to do with it
Would you know what to do
Would you know what to do baby if it was you
Would you know what to do
Would you know what to do with it
Would you know what to do
Would you know what to do or would you be confused baby if it were you
If I gave my heart I gave my all to you
If it where your heart all I'm asking you
If you focused on paper they focus on drama
When you feel like this game puts a strain on you and your momma
When you feel like you're going insane all these nigga's acting strange
And you feel like nobody else is feeling your pain
My heart belong to you
My good my bad my now my past
If you take that
If I gave my all to you
My use my do's my new life now
If you where me if I where you
If you had to walk a mile in my shoes
If nobody else would ride with you
And you only 22 what would you doGet off my dick let me do me

Don't tell me to prove it 'cause I might lose it
I ain't gotta tell you why I do it
I ain't gotta tell you why I do it
I ain't gotta tell you why I do it
I ain't gotta tell you why I do it
I ain't gotta tell you why I do it
Don't have to tell you the plan is relentless
I ain't gotta tell you why I do it
Nigga that's my business
Even if you say you don't fuck with it that's coolAll in first class with the champagne
Sorry lame niggas but you can't hang
Shawty say she fucking with the campaign
Tap me on the shoulder for the bangbangEver since day one
Somebody probably say you wouldn't be nothin'
I bet they told you this over and over again on repeat like a rerun
Nobody ever told you you could live up
To anything you want don't give up
They rather tell you you're destined for failure
That's what they tell you
But you just say
What about Martin
What about Garvey
What about Rosa
What about Malcolm
What if somebody told them they would never be nothin'
And they believed this think about the outcome
Would we even be the way we are today
Even if it weren't could have been a harder way
Even though we lost a lot of people on the way
Had to sacrifice to get us in a better place
I hope you listen to these wizzords
All they want us thinking about is sipping on some sizzurp
And they got us thinking something better we don't deserve
And that you shouldn't try it's no use
But that couldn't be further from the truth
Don't believe it that's what they told me too
When I was growing up 
They told me 
And when I battle it'll hold up
 They told me yeah

That's what they tell what they tell what they tell
When we were little ones
That's what they tell what they tell what they tell
They supposed to be kings and queens
That's what they tell what they tell what they tell
When we don't believe them
That's what they tell what they tell what they tell
Trying to live the American Dream
They say the ballers is celebrities
As a reminder of the people they would never be
Jealousy got 'em sick without a remedy
Thinking when I die nobody's gonna remember me
I was told that nobody care
So the dreams that I had turned to nightmares
Is this thing called life really fair
Need help but it ain't there
So you know it's really hard to stay dedicated
When the ballers screaming they was never educated
On the corner getting high just to medicate it
'Cause the teachers just told him he would never make it
Now he feeling like he made it 'cause he stackin' paper
But probably won't let him spend the money later
Nobody ever told us we could be greater
To everybody on the grind and the paper chasers
I hope you listen to these wizzords
All they want us thinking about is sipping on some sizzurp
And they got us thinking something better we don't deserve
And that you shouldn't try it's no use
But that couldn't be further from the truth
Don't believe it that's what they told me too
When I was growing up 
They told me 
And when I battle it'll hold up
 They told me yeah

That's what they tell what they tell what they tell
When we were little ones
That's what they tell what they tell what they tell
We're supposed to be kings and queens
That's what they tell what they tell what they tell
When we don't believe them
That's what they tell what they tell what they tell
Trying to live the American Dream

They'd rather see me dead never gone make it

They'd rather see me fail never gonna be anything

Getting to this money getting getting to this money
Getting to this money getting getting to this money

All I do is grind and pray riding through these streets all day

Getting to this money getting getting to this money

Girl 'cause what you do and what I do ain't different
We both on a mission I love your ambition

Two wrongs don't make it right
But two strong make a power couple
And our trouble is small talkers
Talking down on the big spenders
But the winners focus on the win
And sore losers focus on the winners
Stacked up shawty stacked up shawty

Blacked up foree his and hers 'Cedes

Where were all these niggas at claiming they my fam
If I lost it all tomorrow I know they won't give a damn

Wish you could put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends that ain't friends no more

Cuz I ain't have what them other kids had
I remember wishin' that I knew my dad
Then I remember wishin' I could get him back
For every single night that he told me he was comin' and he didn't
For every single dollar that my mama 'nem was missin'
For every thing I wanted and was told I couldn't get it
And that I had to face it that my daddy was addicted 
That's right it wasn't easy growin' up
Mama was exposin' us to life as she knew it
So we all went through it
I remember bein' down and out sleepin' on my homie's couch
In  outta trouble ever since my mama put me out
Damn it's getting real damn it's getting real

So I hit da block selling rocks just to eat a meal
So I grabbed da Glock kept it cocked
Peace is being still
In da back of da tracks my nigga's stayed wit da packs
And if a nigga was schemin' my brotha stayed with tha gat
Yea yea we stayed in da trap yea everyday in da trap
These ho's was chasin' da cheese so we would stay wit da rat's
And we was ridin' down dippin' low I stayed in da back
In the X5 stuntin' we ain't know how to act
Spendin' money like it's nothin' cuz we gone get it back
17 never thought that I'd be gettin' dem racks
Had a dream but I said I wasn't fuckin' wit that
Mel told me I would make it I ain't fuckin' wit that
But he told me that it wouldn't hurt to give it a try
Hardest thing out in New Orleans never see 25
Right then I woke up broke out told my nigga's had to roll out
Moved to the A and got motivated that inspiration don't run out
Heard my brother got gunned down and it hurt me to my heart
So I kept grindin' I kept pushin' he told me to go far
So I can't stop at no crib can't stop at no car
Gotta keep going like there ain't no tomorrow
So I'm goin' hard everyday 'til I got nothin' to say nothin' can stand in my way
I gotta stay to show my nigga's a different way
Imma tell da truth and da whole truth
Cuz there ain't no need to lie
And I ain't tryna keep it all inside
So I gotta testify
For you and I I testify

Paying our respects to bein' broke hope he's in a better place
'Cause life out here ain't sweet oh no
I would close my eyes to sleep but didn't dream no more
So I had to make a way for my home you know
Now I'm in a place where I ain't gotta scheme no more
The good life I'm done with the hood life
I did what I could but didn't always do what I should and I was misunderstood
So many nights I tried
To hide how I felt I would cry inside
And I ran through the streets till my feet got tired
'Cause I ain't wanna have my shoes on them power lines
But I made it and it made me
I know I did wrong I prayed to God he forgave me
'Cause I made it and it didn't kill me
So it made me stronger I pray to God that you feel me that you feel me
Started off in the streets

Now that I got your attention
Let us in with the benediction
Our father who art in heaven
I pray you free me from my demons and keep me level
I know you kept my out of prison where I was headin'
When I heard someone killed my brother oneeightyseven
I hope he made it to your presence for me he was a blessin'
At least I know he's restin' and he ain't out here stressin'
Tryna get to the good life and out of this hood life
I pray that my steppops stay off that crack pipe
So mama could sleep at night I know it's been hard on her
I was ripping through the streets it was hard for her
Now I'm up in hotels on the ocean shore
When I was sleepin' on the floor at the corner store
But I made it and it made me
I know I did wrong I prayed to God he would save me
'Cause I made it it didn't kill me
So it made me stronger I pray to God that you feel me that you feel me

Rightin' all my wrongs for these homies out here thuggin'
Pray for benediction pretty women on my premise
Condo out in Cabo screaming GABOS to my nemesis
Gold around my neck I'm ballin' for these final minutes
Nothing lasts forever for these sins I seek repentance
Shots fired another gone I feel that man's pain
Daddy sat me down and said that came with the game
Shake my head roll up the window turnin' up the music
So much anger in these songs for these soldiers that we losin'
A mastermind is one who's feedin' others off his talent
I owe it to my city but it's time I pay my balance
I'm in Holyfield's estate I started with a pallet
I made my first tape I gave that shit to Khaled
Thankful for my supporters everyone that ever bought us
Grateful for every lesson these by any streets taught us
Started off in the streets
We would take collection from the fiends

Will be my claim to fame
A man with no name
That way I won't have to feel the pain
Indispensable
Just a plain old human being
Today don't mean a thing
In a world that's so mean
A world that seems not for me
So privately I'll be invisible
That way I won't have to explain a thing if you know what I mean
I won't even have to be here on the scene
It's so ridiculous
But the strife and the bliss
Will go right on through right on through me
To have missed
All the things that hurt your soul
No one would ever know
They'd never know
Life so preciously
Just don't seem to be
As free as they claim freedom to be
Things are going fast
To have found that all is in the past
To have to take what you can get
Sure can make a heart upset
Inconspicuous
I must behave myself
For somebody else
Who may have a little fame fortune and wealth
It's so ridiculous
But the strife and the bliss
Will go right on through right on through me
To have missed
A world that seems not for me
So privately I'll be invisible
That way I won't have to explain a thing if you know what I mean
I won't even have to be here on the scene
It's so ridiculous
But the strife and the bliss
Will go right on through right on through me
To have missed
All the things that hurt your soul
No one would ever know

Life so preciously
Just don't seem to me
As free as they claim freedom to be
Things are going fast
To have found that all is in the past
To have to take what you can get
Sure can make a heart upset
So I'll be invisible

Pride is something that I seem to lack
Our relations in danger
And you act like a stranger
But this time I'm not flyin'
'Cause I ain't got the time
Make a mess of me
Which wasn't supposed to be
We were supposed to change
It couldn't be arranged
Your mama's son
And sisters do
All here today
Unite and true
Say exit left
I'll help myself
Distrust your sign
Ain't got no time
Playin a fuse
And your engine cuttin loose
I won't say that we're losing
It's just of mutual chosen
Cause what is yours is mine
It's just yours and not mine
Your not goin to mess up my mind
Cause I ain't got the time
Our love have gone to blow
Can't get hung up no more
And now ain't nothing left
Get up and help yourself
You double crossed
Your love was false
Ignored advice
And blew our life
Your useless prayer
I cannot bear
It wasn't fair
You should have cared
Ain't got it 
Your mama's son
And sisters do
All here today
Unite and true
Say exit left
I'll help myself
Distrust your sign
Ain't got no time
Ain't got it 
You double crossed
Your love was false
Ignored advice
And blew our life
Your useless prayer
I cannot bear
It wasn't fair
You should have caredEverybody's talking
About this country's state
We get a new power every hour
Just about every Christian faith
We're killing up our leaders
It don't matter none Black or White
We all know it's wrong
But who's gonna fight to make it right
Mighty Mighty Spade and Whitey
Your Black and White Power
Is gonna be a crumblin' tower
And we who stand divided
So goddamned undecided
Give this some thought
In stupidness we've all been caught
There really ain't no difference
God knows there ain't no difference
If you're cut you're gonna bleed
Can I get a little bit deeper
May I go a little deeper
Human life is from semen seed
I want to say it loud
I got to say it loud
I want to say in louder
I got to say it loud
I'm Black and I'm proud
Just like the brothers do
And just like all the rest
We don't want no mess
About who's taking who

Mighty Mighty Spade and Whitey
Your Black and White power
Is gonna be a crumblin' towerPeople get ready
There' a train acoming
You don't need no baggage
You just get on board
All you need is faith
To hear the diesels humming
Don't need no ticket
You just thank the Lord
People get ready
For the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers
From coast to coast
Faith is the key
Open the doors and board them
There's room for all
Among the loved the most

To save his own
Have pity on those
Whose chances are thinner
Cause there's no hiding place
From the Kingdom's Throne
So people get ready
For the train acoming
You don't need no baggage

All you need is faith
To hear the diesels humming

No one's ever been oh good to me since then
Everywhere I looked it seemed so color bright
There were never such things to me as black and white
Remember when we were part of that special few
Everything it seemed was so pure and true
I guess we were just too young to understand
The unselfish cause of death and war and roles of man
Only only only a child
Only only only a child
Only only only a child
Only a child again hey hey
If I were only a child again
I would never want to venture life like this again
People of the world hurling sticks and stones
Like the sore fates of one come up and break my bones
Only only only a child
If I were only a child again
And have the ability to understand
I'd speak for little people from the date of birth
And ask the grown ups when will there be peace on earth
Grown ups when will there be peace on earth
Brother when will there be peace on earth
Only only only a child
Only only only a child
Only only only a child
Only a child again hey heyThey say it's alright

Making a new day
Leading in a new way
Respect for those people
Power to the people
Setting down the old crew
Bringing in the brand new
Wild and free with peace finally
Wild and free is the way I want my life
Natures wait for me
Without pain in its stride
Fighting what is wrong
Across the world as well as home
But respect for everybody's right
Would be really out of sight
Our great obligations
Would not be bad situation
If the young what we listen to
For what they really know is true
Respect for those people
Power to the people
The old people who worry 'bout me
'Cause I am so wild and free
Wild and free is the way I wanna be
Making a new day
Leading in a new way
Respect for those people
Power to the peopleHush now child and don't you cry
Your folks might understand you by and by
Move on up toward your destination
You may find from time to time
Complication
Bight your lip and take a trip
Though there may be wet road ahead
And you cannot slip
So move on up for peace will find
Into the steeple of beautiful people
Where there's only one kind
So hush now child and don't you cry
Your folks might understand you by and by
Move on up and keep on wishing
Remember your dream is your only scheme
So keep on pushing
Take nothing less than the second best
Do not obey you must keep your say
You can past the test
Just move on up to a greater day
With just a little faith
If you put your mind to it you can surely do itWe people who are darker than blue
Are we gonna stand around this town
And let what others say come true
We're just good for nothing they all figure
A boyish grown up shiftless jigger
Now we can't hardly stand for that
Or is that really where it's at
We people who are darker than blue
This ain't no time for segregatin'
I'm talking 'bout brown and yellow two
High yellow girl can't you tell
You're just the surface of our dark deep well
If your mind could really see
You'd know your color the same as me
Pardon me brother as you stand in your glory
I know you won't mind if I tell the whole story
Get yourself together learn to know your side
Shall we commit our own genocide
Before you check out your mind
I know we've all got problems
That's why I'm here to say
Keep peace with me and I with you
Let me love in my own way
Now I know we have great respect
For the sister and mother it's even better yet
But there's the joker in the street
Loving one brother and killing the other
When the time comes and we are really free
There'll be no brothers left you see
We people who are darker than blue
Don't let us hang around this town
And let what others say come true
We're just good for nothing they all figure
A boyish grown up shiftless jigger
Now we can't hardly stand for that
Or is that really where it's at
Pardon me brother while you stand in your glory
I know you won't mind if I tell the whole story
Pardon me brother I know we've come a long long way
But let us not be so satisfied for tomorrow can be an
An even brighter dayIt is my theory
The two of us are somewhat leery
About the happiness
We both set out to posses
We've got all the comforts of life
A few kids and you are my wife
And I tell it like it is
I must confess
I'm gonna have to give it up
I'm gonna have to give it up
All concern and the trusts that never happened with us
The walk of embraces and the love of our faces
It never happened you see and I'm so sorry
I really truly love you
And the kids you must agree
And I never had too much
Concern or interest in astrology
But as I read it must be so
The invulnerable word incompatible
No matter how much we try
Our indifference but still show
Now we've got give it up
I'm gonna have to give it up
All concern and the trusts that never happened with us
The walk of embraces and the love of our faces
It never happened you see and I'm so sorry
Now we've got give it up ooh child
I've got to have to give it up
Lord have mercy
Now I've got give it up ooh
I've got to give it up
All concern and the trusts that never happened with us
The walk of embraces and the love of our faces
It never happened you see and I'm so sorry
But now we've got to give it up
What am I do
Child we've got to give it up
I'll be so lonely without you
But now I've got to give it up
Lord forgive me ooh
I've got to give it up ooh
Now I've got to give it up
Lord I have to give it upLittle child runnin' wild

Never meant that much to me
The woman I thought was just so
She now tells me we ain't compatible
She said see look right here on the paper
You should be lovin' your neighbor
Lovin' my neighbor is out of sight
But I'm your man and I'm just trying to do right
But I can see there's some trouble coming
Right here with this funky woman
But now the thoughts she had for me
Like I see is gone to some astrology
Well baby I can see your plan
You better wake up before its too late
straighten up and make up your mind
Or you'll need a horoscope to
Find another love sign
Readings in astrology
Never meant that much to me
The woman I thought was just so
She now tells me we ain't compatible

It is true the makings of you
The righteous way to go
Little one would know
Or believe if I told them so
You're second to none
The love of all mankind
Should reflect some sign of these words
I've tried to recite
They're close but not quite
Almost impossible to do
Reciting the makings of you

Little one would know

Out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share
Or how to care
I never had no teachings
About being fair
Depression is part of my mind
The sun never shines
On the other side of town
The need here is always for more
There's nothing good in store
On the other side of town
It's hard to do right
In this filthy night
Just plain simple comfort
Is completely out of sight
My little sister she hungry
For bread to eat
My brother's hand me down shoes
Are now showing his feet
Ghetto blues showed on the news
All is aware but
What the hell do they care
You across the track
Completely relaxed
You take a warning fact
Don't you never come back
I'm from the other side of town
Out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share
Or how to care
I never had no teachings
About being fair
Depression is part of my mind
The sun never shines
On the other side of town
The need here is always for more
There's nothing good in store
On the other side of town
Oh baby it's hard to do right you know
On the other side of town
Depression really got a hold on me
On the other side of townWe want the power for the people
That's all we ask in our country dear
The sick and the hungry are unable
Protect them and those who may live in fear
We as the young wish to say in this song
God bless great America
We give thanks to the old for acheiving their goal
It is now up to us and we know we must build up a trust
And we want the power for the people
That's all we ask in our country dear
The sick and the hungry are unable
Protect them and those who may live in fear
Power for the people
Power for the people
Power for the people
Hardening crimes is a part of the times nd it's rough for some people to live
Disease can move fast but it don't have to last
It is now the nation's turn for all to be concerned
We can be freer still it is the people's will
And bring back the power for the people
That's all we ask in our country dear
The sick and the hungry are unable
Protect them and those who may live in fear

You hurt me bad
I'm all too sad

You had a plan
Another man
Went off to hide
I could have died
Now you're gone
What shall I do
My world is blue
This isn't true
My life is through
Now you're gone
I want you back
How do I act
To make contact
and get respect
Now you're gone
I lay inside
The other guy
He was my friend
and part of kin
Now you're gone
And I never loved nobody
Who's been mean to me  never did
I got a heart full of stone
Heart full of stone
and I hate the misery
And then you

And then you came along
You had to come along
Destroyin' me mama
And now you're gone

Now you're gone
Now you're gone
I lay inside
The other guy
He was my friend
and part of kin
Now you're goneEverybody gather round and listen to my song
I've only got one
We who are young should now take a stand
Don't run from the burdens of women and men
Continue to give continue to live
For what you know is right
Most of your life can be out of sight
Withdraw from the darkness and look to the light
Where everyone's free
At least that's the way it's supposed to be
We just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on
Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us
And there's still a lot of faith and warmth and trust
When we keep on keeping on
Before we dismiss one thing I insist
When you have your young remember this song
And our world surroundings its leaps and bounds
Ups and downs is reality
Teach them to be strong and when they are grown
They can proudly imply that we were an alright guy
For all the wrong now is right
This nation's people are now united as one
And we just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on
Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us
And there's still a lot of faith warmth and trust
When we keep on keeping on
Keep on keeping on y'all
Keep on keep on keep on keep on
Keep on keeping on

We got to move on up y'all

Keep on keep on keep on keep on keep on
Some years back I remember
Still in my mind so well
My mama made this 
And I found it never fails
Never worry too long

About what goes on

Today it's sorrow

Look like joy tomorrow

Keep on keeping on

Keep on keep on

We just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on
Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us
And there's still a lot of faith warmth and trust
When we keep on keeping on
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

We're gonna move on up

Keep on keeping on

Move on move now

Keep on keeping on
Through loving you I seem to feel a spirit
Deep inside of me
Preciously guiding me
My woman of all women dear to me
Forever love me
For I need you constantly
Still you hold me close indeed
Helping to keep this love I need
Feels so much like your touch divine
Drinking and getting high on wine
Wanting to love you all the time
Just love to keep you in my mind
Just love to keep you in my mind
Your face is so mysteriously kind
I bet that love is partial to your sign
Somehow I do believe that you are mine
Proving in a natural way
Things that I could never think to say
Still you hold me close indeed
Helping to keep this love I need
Feels so much like your touch divine
Drinking and getting high on wine
Wanting to love you all the time
Just love to keep you in my mind
Just love to keep you in my mind
The magic that you secretly possess
Oooh I must confess
Must be working at its best
My love for you is one you'll always know
Wherever we may go
You will find that it is so
And still you hold me close indeed
Helping to keep this love I need
Feels so much like your touch divine
Drinking and getting high on wine
Wanting to love you all the time
Just love to keep you in my mind
I just love to keep you in my mindGet down baby

All our world is true it's trueJust out of Monday
I run into a friend
Down the street down the street
Where I live
Sad things begin
I could feel from within
From the message from the message
He had to give
About a buddy of mine
He run out of time his life run out of time
Somebody past noon shot across the room
And now the man no longer lives
Too bad about him
Too sad about him
Don't get me wrong the man is gone
But it's a wonder he lived this long
Up in the city they called him Boss Jack
But down home he was an alley cat
Ah didn't care nothing about being black
Oh Billy Jack
There can't be no fun can't be no fun
To be shot shot with a hand gun
Your body sprawled out you without a doubt
Running people out there on the floor
Sad bloody mess
Shot all up in his chest shot in his chest
One sided duel gun and a fool ah
What a way to go
Up in the city they called him Boss Jack
But down home he was a alley cat
Ah didn't care nothin' 'bout being Black
Oh Billy JackFreddie's dead
That's what I said
Let the man rap a plan
Said he'd see him home
But his hope was a rope
And he should've known
Everybody's misused him
Ripped him up and abused him
Another junkie plan
Pushing dope for the man
A terrible blow
But that's how it goes
A Freddie's on the corner now
If you want to be a junkie wow
Remember Freddie's dead
We're all built up with progress
But sometimes I must confess
We can deal with rockets and dreams
But reality what does it mean
Ain't nothing said
'Cause Freddie's dead
Hey hey
Love love
Ha ha
Love love
Yeah yeah
Ha ha
Love love
Freddie's dead
All I want is some peace of mind
With a little love I'm trying to find
This could be such a beautiful world
With a wonderful girl
Why I need a woman child
Don't want to be like Freddie now
'Cause Freddie's dead
Everybody's misused him
Ripped him up and abused him
Another junkie plan
Pushing dope for the man
A Freddie's on the corner now
If you want to be a junkie why
Remember Freddie's dead
Ha ha ha ha ha
Freddie's deadI just can't wait to love you
Gotta see my woman right now
We ain't getting any younger
Need someone to love
When clouds come it's rainin'
Sun come up and shine shine shine
Lord I ain't complainin'
I've done a little bit wrong and I said a lot of times
But if there's any good in me
I'll bring it out so that you might see that
I'm just another lonely man that
Wanna stop all the crimes and start over again
And I just can't wait in the line
Gotta see my woman right now
We ain't getting any younger
Need someone to love
This woman on the other side
She's every bit of the better half and all of my pride
Though I've hurt her so constantly
She's always had faith and trust in me
But how long can a good thing last
Though I vow never to hurt her in the past
Will she be there waiting for me
Five long years now you will free free free
Need someone to love
Gotta see my woman right now
We ain't getting any younger
Need someone to love
I just can't wait to love you
Gotta see my woman right now
We ain't getting any younger
Need someone to loveSisters brothers and the whities
Blacks and the crackers
Police and their backers
They're all political actors
Hurry
People running from their worries
While the judge and the juries
Dictate the law that's partly flaw
Cat calling love balling fussing and cussing
Top billing now is killing
For peace noone is willing
Kind of make you get that feeling
Everybody smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke
Use the pill and the dope dope dope dope dope
Educated fools
From uneducated schools
Pimping people is the rule
Polluted water in the pool
And Nixon talking about don't worry worry worry worry
He says don't worry worry worry worry
He says don't worry worry worry worry
He says don't worry worry worry worry
But they don't know
There can be no show
And if there's a hell below
We're all gonna go go go go go
Everybody's praying
And everybody's saying
But when come time to do
Everybody's laying
Just talking about don't worry worry worry worry
They say don't worry worry worry worry
They say don't worry worry worry worry
They say don't worry worry worry worryOnly you babe 
Only you babe 
Only you babe
Only you babe 
Only you babe 
Only you babe
Sometimes I get a little lonely 
I'm lonely for you girl
All my body pains only need for the good things
All the making love and breaking bread
Face to face get down with the love most inner place
With only you babe 
Oh all this love can be replaced
I pick up love upon your face
I kiss your lips my body breaks
You lift me up and turn me around
You can appreciate this good love can't go down
Only you babe 
Only you baby 
Only you babe
Only you baby

Only you baby
People don't understand
Misled with there intents
Think they can get along with anyone
Who gives sweet sweet sweet complementDo be do be do be do be
Everybody say to you all the time

Everyone no one but no one can find

A human need that is never failed
But baby I don't care
Just do be there and do be down
Its tender love just what is love and what you like
I give you me you give me you and that's alright
Guess what I'm trying to say
In this gradual way of the love we've found
Since you finally unwound
Just do be you and do be down
I just wanna know no matter where we go
Girl let's not distrust what we adore
Strangers it may sound
Let's keep this love around
You for me me for you
That's all I wanna do
Do be do
But everybody say to you all the time
To be true
Everyone no one but no one can find

A human need that is never found
But baby I don't care

Well baby I don't care do be there
And do be down
Well baby I don't care do be there
And do be down
Well baby I don't care do be there

With the moon shining bright
There's a set goin' strong
Lotta things goin' on
The man of the hour
Has an air of great power
The dudes have envied him for so long
Oh superfly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ahhaha
Hard to understand
What a hell of a man
This cat of the slum
Had a mind wasn't dumb
But a weakness was shown
'Cause his hustle was wrong
His mind was his own
But the man lived alone
Oh superfly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ahhaha
The game he plays he plays for keeps
Hustlin' times and ghetto streets
Tryin' ta get over

Taking all that he can take
Gambling with the odds of fate
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over
Woo superfly
The aim of his role
Was to move a lot of blow
Ask him his dream
What does it mean
He woudn't know
Can't be like the rest
Is the most he'll confess
But the time's running out
And there's no happiness
Oh superfly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ahhaha
Superfly

You're so good to me  you see
I could never get over you get over you get over you
cause you're so good to meIf you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose my brothers
If there was no day or night
Which would you prefer to be right
How long have you hated your white teacher
Who told you you love your black preacher
Do you respect your brother's woman friend
And share with black folks not of kin
People must prove to the people
A better day is coming for you and for me
With just a little bit more education
And love for our nation would make a better society
Now some of us would rather cuss and make a fuss
Than to bring about a little trust
But we shall overcome our beliefs someday
If you'll only listen to what I have to say
And how long have you hated your white teacher
Who told you you love your black preacher
Can you respect your brother's woman friend
And share with black folks not of kin
I said now people must prove to the people
A better day is coming for you and for me
With just a little bit more education
And love for our nation would make a better society
And if you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose my brothers
If there was no day or night
Which would you prefer to be right
If you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose my brothersEddie you should know better
Brother you know you're wrong
Think of the tears and fears
You bring to your folks back home
They'd say where did he go wrong my Lord
We planned and worked hard from the very start
Tried to make him better than all the rest
But the brother proved to be so much less
Eddie is everybody's friend
But sometimes you wonder now and then
The only time he'll choose you
When there's something to lose through
His personal loss
And the friend pays the cost all the timeDear I thought I drop a line
The weather is cool
The fools are fine
I'm in bed each night at nine
Ps I love you
Yesterday we had some rain
But all in all I can't complain
Was it dusty on the train
Ps I love you
Write to the brown's just as soon as you're able
They came around to call
And not burn a hole in the dining room table
Now let me think I guess that's all
Nothing else for me to say
And so I'll close but by the way
Everybody's thinking of you
Ps I love youLet's not forget though trying times there are
We have not lost the war by far
Still work to be done and as the old hymn says
We all can overcome
Let's not forget the sunrise in the sky
The love and wonders why you don't do or die
But at best you try
Don't let life pass you by
Do what you do when you're feeling free
You can be what you want to be
Open your mind and you can see
Baby let's not forget this love is all we need
Kiss me once and maybe kiss me twice
Sweetens the spice of life my child
Just give me a smile
It is your big world to make it all worthwhile
Let's not forget advice on love today
I'm really not so wise this way
So what do you say two loving human beings
Just trying to make a way
Do what you do when you're feeling free my baby
You can be what you want to be right now
Open your mind and you can see alright
Baby let's not forget this love is all we need
My baby my baby my baby
Do what you do when you're feeling free
You can be what you want to be
Open your mind and you can see
Baby let's not forget this love is all we need
Do what you do when you're feeling free my baby
You can be what you want to be right now
Open your mind and you can see alright
Baby let's not forget this love is all we need
Do what you do when you're feeling free my baby
You can be what you want to be right nowHow did I get so far gone
Where do I belong
And where in the world did I ever go wrong
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone
Perched up in a rockingchair
With my feet all bare
Rolling my blunt in a cigar wrap
Live an adolescent mind
Never do take the time
Waiting for my high quiet as it's kept
How did I get so far gone
Where do I belong
And where in the world did I ever go wrong
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone
Mama told me I was best
Argue and punch in the chest
Son now be strong let me take you home
I'd see in her eyes so sincere
Screaming what got me here
Standing in the world with my mind all blown
How did I get so far gone
Where do I belong
And where in the world did I ever go wrong
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone
How did I get so far gone
Where do I belong
And where in the world did I ever go wrong
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone
I do nothing but waste all my time
Leaving the world behind
Smoking my crack just to keep me high
Around the boys I play my part rough
Keep myself tough enough
Never to cry don't really wanna die
How did I get so far gone
Where do I belong
And where in the world did I ever go wrong
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone
How did I get so far gone
Where do I belong
And where in the world did I ever go wrong
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone
How did I get so far gone
Where do I belong
And where in the world did I ever go wrong
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm goneWhen the lights are closing
And the people are crying
The super people come along

Super people did what they did
We need to help them become better
The super people are mice and brave
When you go to sleep you cry
And cry the super people will be there
I know you know he's getting over
The rumors say he's fooling around
Your face sadly pressed upon my shoulder
Too bad to hear he's putting you down
'cause no one knows about a good thing
Until a good thing is gone
Remember when you loved a good thing
To lose one is just no fun
No one knows about a sweet thing
Until the sweet thing is gone
Baby dry your eyes you don't have to cry
You know I love you love you so madly oh yeah
Again you've been pushed
Pushed off to the curdle oh yeah
I begged to take you I've held you so gladly
Just give me some sign baby say the word
'cause no one knows about a good thing
Until the good thing is gone
Remember when you loved a good thing
To lose one is just no fun
No one knows about a sweet thing
Until the sweet thing is gone
Baby dry your eyes you don't have to cry
I guess no one knows what you've really been living at
It's funny like that
I don't wanna complete that
I just wanna I just wanna
Don't mean to push but my love's in a hurry yes baby
I'm standing here like I'm gonna die
I must admit you've got me so worried
I just want for us to give it a try give it a try
'cause no one knows about a good thing
Until the good thing is gone
Remember when you loved a good thing
To lose one is just no fun
No one knows about a sweet thing
Until the sweet thing is gone
Baby dry your eyes you don't have to cry
No one knows about a good thing
Remember when you loved a good thing
To lose one is just no fun
No one knows about a sweet thing
Until the sweet thing is gone
Baby dry your eyes you don't have to cry
Don't cry baby don't cry baby
Don't cry baby sweet baby
No one knows about a sweet thing
Until the sweet thing is goneHere's another girl
And I am afraid that she'll be gone
Like the others before her
And here's another chance
To make myself belong
And this time I wanna keep her
For this girl I find
Stays on my mind
She has opened up my eyes
As though I were blind
Oh Lord I must find the strength somewhere
For I find I really care
And today's opportunity has at last
Found someone to share
The things I wouldn't have dared
'Cause I never felt that were meant for me
But this girl I find
Stays on my mind
She has opened up my eyes
As though I were blind
This girl I find
Stays on my mind
She has opened up my eyes
As though I were blind
Oh Lord I must find the strength somewhere
'Cause I find I really care
And today's opportunity has at last
Found someone to share
The things I wouldn't have dared
'Cause I never felt that were meant for me
And here's another girl
And I am afraid that she'll be gone
Like the others before her
Here's another chance
To make myself belong
And this time I wanna keep her
If she's really for me
If she's really for me
I am gonna wait and see
I am gonna wait and see
If she's really for me
If she's really for me
I am gonna wait and see
I love you I love you
I am gonna wait and see
If you're really for meLittle child
Runnin' wild
Watch a while
You see he never smiles
Broken home
Father gone
Mama tired
So he's all alone
Kind of sad
Kind of mad
Ghetto child
Thinkin' he's been had
In the back of his mind he's sayin'
Didn't have to be here
You didn't have to love for me
While I was just a nothin' child
Why couldn't they just let me be
Let me be let me be let me be
One room shack
On the alleyback
Control I'm told
From across the track
Where is the mayor
Who'll make all things fair
He lives outside
Our polluted air
And I didn't have to be here
You didn't have to love for me
While I was just a nothin' child
Why couldn't they just let me be
Let me be let me be let me be
I got a Jones
Runnin' through ma' bones
I'm sorry son
All your money's gone
Painful rip
In my upper hip
I guess it's time
To take another trip
Don't care what nobody say
I got to take the pain away
It's getting worser day by day
And all my life has been this way
Can't reason with the pusher man
Finance is all that he understands
You junkie mama cries you know
Would rip her but I love her so
Love her so nowYou know I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy
You see I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy
I found out in time
What was on your mind
You never meant to stay
Did without me anyway
One of the chosen few
Did what you told me to
All you ever did was lie
I can't satisfy
So I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy
You seem so complete
So pretty and sweet
But never knew I'd know
Just which way you're going to
Sometimes I wonder why
Why do you make me cry
Why do the love inside
Swallows up all of my pride
And I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy
And I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy
You seem so complete
So pretty and sweet
But never knew I'd know
Just which way you're going to
Sometimes I wonder why
Why do you make me cry
Why do the love inside
Swallows all of my pride
And I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy
I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy
One of the chosen few
Did what you told me to
All you ever did was lie
I can't satisfy
And I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy
I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy
And I can't satisfy your loveSo there's nothing left
What can I say other than take care of yourself
Till the ends of the earth I suppose
There's everyone's worldly vow
But somehow it seems mine
Have seem to have stopped half way
Maybe I wanna let things just come with me
So you don't love me
I am not accusing you
Do what you think you are oughta do
For it's just one thing and then another
Like you don't love me
So you don't love me
We'd given it all a final try
You've hurt me so bad I could have died
But ain't no hard feelings
I won't worry my mind with such dealings
So you don't love me
In a world already filled with misery
I have no intentions to let my spirit come right on me
Live on through the years keep some proud on my face
The scar of the disgrace I guess I got to find me a better place
Wherever you might be keep yourself alright
Every heart I suppose got to slip out little light
Hope the other cares as much I used to do
Keep your love life true keep your love life true
You don't love me
In a world already filled with misery
I have no intentions to let my spirit come right on me
Live on through the years and keep some proud on my face
The scar of the disgrace I guess I got to find me a better place
So I am not accusing you
Do what you think you oughta do
For it's just one thing and then another
So you don't love me
So you don't love me
So you don't love me
You don't love me
You don't love me
So you don't love me
So you don't love me
You don't love me
You don't love me
You don't love me
So you don't love me
You don't love me
So you don't love meWe're a winner and never let anybody say
Boy you can't make it 'cause a feeble mind is in your way
No more tears do we cry
And we have finally dried our eyes
And we're movin' on up

Lord have mercy we're movin' on up

We're living proof in alls alert
That we're two from the good black earth
And we're a winner

We need to cool at night for our future
For the little pretty boys and girls
We need to take a time come together
Are you willing
So we can make it right for the people
And everyone I love will come
Just a little bit of love to make it right
Just a little bit of time to cool at night
Just a little bit of space to keep us tight
We gotta come together
We gotta come together
Everybody searchin' in confusion
No solution
We look inside ourselves for the answer
But we really don't understand
We all must be unplanned
To start sharing to start caring
And if the sun shines your way
You will find love 'cause love is the only way
Just a little bit of love to make it right
Just a little bit of time to cool at night
Just a little bit of space to keep us tight
Just a little bit just a little bit of love
Aye man it seems so hopeful for blazin' my days
And brother let's begin a stress off my chest with some sex
Can I get a little love for my peeps in the streets
But this killing for colors aye man this shit gotta cease peace
Nothin' zero zilch amounts to what
Nothin' but you've gotta have somethin'
'cause we're comin' comin' correct and together eternally
And with that little bit of love we may live forever
See it's a time to live there's a time to die
But when the livin' gets rough that's the time I realize
I've gotta think twice using my ears to hear L O V E
Just love just love just love just love
Just a little bit of love to make it right
Just a little bit of time to cool at night
Just a little bit of space to keep us tight
Just a little bit just a little bit of love
Now look all around you
Children dyin' people cryin' no no
But nobody seem to care
Till it's their time they really don't give a damn
We've got to find a way to start loving
To start giving yeah
But if we procrastinate and we blow it
Then everybody'll go to hell
Just a little bit of love to make it right
Just a little bit of time to cool at night
Just a little bit of space to keep us tight
We gotta keep together
We gotta keep together
We don't need destruction we don't need it
We don't need to care no no
We don't need corruption
We just need to cheer just a little bit
We don't need attacking no no
We don't need the pain
We don't need to cry down we don't need it
We just need to change let me just a little bit
Just a little bit of love to make it right

Just a little bit of space to keep us tight
Love can love can be
Livin' life to see
All my children free ooh
Just a little bit of loveI just want you to know
That I really really think you're something special
Wanna try hard to show
Make it sweet sweet sweet wherever we go
Just to know love is true
Heaven blessed truth in you
I just want to be with you
Just to have you baby by my side
Love would be the only rule
You're gonna see baby how hard I can try
None will ever do so well
Like a load of farming fairy tale
Oh no baby baby
I just want you to know
When I first saw you baby I fell to the floor
Dreaming you in my head
Understanding love with nothing you can say
I need you baby you know I do
Taking every part of you
Want to be with you
Love the way you tell my friends you're true
Want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I just want to be with youDarkness no longer a child is born
Mother shed tears of joy as baby test his lungs
My daddy's not there where he ought to be
Somewhere in Georgia skinning and shooting craps on his knees
Another victim born out here in the hood
And based on statistics it really ain't all good
Welfare takes the tab and daddy can't sign
And it can't be seen the family becomes a crime
The hunt is on and brother you're the prey
Serving time in jail it just ain't the way
I'm living so hard baby that my hair is gray
We got to make a change it's a brand new day
A new world order a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race
A new world order a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race
Operation influx and it's on the way
We've just marched a million plus the other day
Look we all witnessed the sweat rolling down Ms Liberty's head
She knows the sleeping giant is no longer sleeping dead
Oh what a fulfillment of prophecy
Let us teach the children freedom's never been free
It's okay to cry go ahead and cry
'Cause Jesus wept but hope and faith he kept
It's a new day
A new world order a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race
A new world order a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race
The die has been cast and there's no need to fear
'Cause people the answer to your prayers are here
Sister Mary don't you weep tell Martha not to moan
We need the love and daddy's coming home
There's no need to worry the times dictate a plan
Mother Earth's given birth to a brand new man
Sister I know you're misunderstood
But hold on to your man 'cause the future looks good
It's a new day
A new world order a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race
A new world order a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race
Beware of the lies and false prophecies
We are many with eyes but don't all really see
You must be merciful my friend to obtain the same
So if you break the chain don't pass the blame
We should say unto all and I'll say it again
It's not just to win shake a hand make a friend
We who are pure at heart somehow might see
There's still light in the world come rejoice with me
It's a new day
A new world order a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race
A new world order a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race
It's a new day it's a new day
It's a new day it's a new day
It's a new day
Yes Lord it's a brand new dayStone junkie stone stone junkie

Go ahead MayfieldI feel like I haven't trust in what has changed has been enough
I couldn't grasp what wasn't there
Until I fell through tongues sweet grab
These fragile eggs will likely crack
Unless we pick another trap
I have myself I've straightened my back
Advance forward I won't look back
I broke this bubble that bought my sense
This machine rebuilt again
What other city can be a test
Do I really think I'm at my best
These fragile eggs will likely crack
Unless we pick another trap
I have myself I've straightened my back
Advance forward I won't look back
I've completely life goes on
I have been up until the sun
Cut through that small place at my back
I will prevail I don't need thatI'm really glad I don't have nothing
that's what the Government it ain't done for me
I got no car
I got no bike but
I've got no misery
And all those divs with plenty of money
they've all put locks on their doors
they're so scared someone's gonna rob em
while they're out making more

Lock it up
Cover it up
We don't want a scandal
Lock it up
Cover it up
That's OKby me
By me

And when it's all said and done
and when they come home from work
and play bridge with their socalled friends
But whoever found pleasure
Scared of too much leisure
Are you sure you're under lock and key
Standin' on a corner
Suitcase in my hand
Jack's in his car says to Jane who's in her vest
Me babe I'm in a rock n' roll band
Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat Jim
Those were different times
And the poets studied rows of verse
And all the ladies rolled their eyes
Sweet Jane Sweet Jane Sweet Jane
Now Jack he is a banker
And Jane she is a clerk
And the both of them are saving up their money
Then they come home from work
Sittin' by the fire
Radio just played a little classical music for you kids
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say
Sweet Jane Sweet Jane Sweet Jane
Some people like to go out dancing
And other people they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you life is full of dirt
And the women never really faint
And the villans always blink their eyes
And the children are the only ones who blush
'Cause life is just to die
But anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it
Sweet JaneI'm waiting for my man
26 dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington 125
Feel sick and dirty
more dead than alive
I'm waiting for my man
Hey white boy what you doing uptown
Hey white boy you chasing our women around
Oh pardon me sir it's furthest from my mind
I'm just lookin' for a dear dear friend of mine
I'm waiting for my man
Here he comes he's all dressed in black
PR shoes and and big straw hat
He's never early he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for my man
Up to a Brownstone up three flights of stairs
Everybody's pinned you but nobody cares
He's got the works gives you sweet taste
Then you gotta split
Because you've got no time to waste ah
I'm waiting for my manEvery second every minute every hour every day
We burden our minds with trivial bullshit same face a different name
The psycho conversation stare at the same four walls until the paint chips away
Well I'm a blind man searchin' for color in a world that's so long been grey
Well I'm a deaf man chasin' the echoes of a song that's already been played
If I could talk to my younger self now I'd say
Don't take nothin' for granted kid
You haven't seen just how bad things can get
And you never know what'cha got 'till it's gone
Never know 'till it's gone
Well I could spew some schematic apology
But it wouldn't do no good
The damage is done so now all we do is run
And pretend our choices haven't killed the best in us
We'll fly a white flag and both say everything had never meant anything at all
And when I'm not passed out and I'm really sleepin'
I'm always dreamin' of you
If I could talk to my younger self now I'd say
Don't take nothin' for granted kid
You haven't seen just how bad things can get
And you never know what'cha got 'till it's gone
Never know 'till it's goneWell I got a gal she lives up on the hill
Well I got a gal she lives up on the hill
Well this woman's tryin' to quit me Lord but I love her still
She's got eyes like diamonds they shine like Klondike gold
She's got eyes like diamonds they shine like Klondike gold
Ev'ry time she loves me she sends my mellow soul
Well you're so beautiful you've got to die someday
Well you're so beautiful you've got to die someday
All I want's a little loving just before you pass away
Pretty baby I'm goin' away and leave you by yourself
Pretty baby I'm goin' away and leave you by yourself
You've mistreated me now you can mistreat somebody elseWell you driving me crazy
What did I do what did I do to you
My tears for you
Makes everything kinda hazy
Clouding clouding the the skies of blue
How true
Were the friends who were near me to cheer me when I needed you
Oh but you
Were the kind to hurt me desert me when I needed you
Say you driving me crazy
What did I do what did I do to you
Well you driving me crazy
What did I do what did I do to you
My tears for you
Makin' everything kinda hazy
Hiding the clouds hiding the clouds of blue
How true
Were the friends who were near me to cheer me when I needed you
Oh but you
Were the kind to hurt me desert me when I needed you
Say you driving me crazy
What did I do what did I do to youI want a little girl to call my own
Just a girl that's all alone
A little girl to fall in love with me
I want a little girl she may not look
like the kind in a story book
But if she can cook she'll suit me to a tee
She doesn't have to wave her hand
Or dress in fancy clothes
And I wouldn't even care
If she didn't wear none at all
I want a little girl to have a lot
I would give her anything I've got
For a little girl to fall in love with me
She doesn't have to wave her hand
Or dress in fancy clothes
And I wouldn't even care
If she didn't wear silken hoseIt was early one Monday mornin'
And I was on my way to school
It was early one Monday mornin'
When I was on my way to school
That was the mornin'
When I broke my mother's rule
I've been in love with you baby
Before I learned to call your name
I've been in love with you baby
Before I learned to call your name
Now you're in love with someone else
I know that's gonna drive me insane
Ooh wee baby

Ooh wee baby
You sure look good to me
Please tell me pretty mama
Who can your great new lover beHow Long Baby how long

And so long so long

Must I keep my clothes in pawn
How long How long
Baby how longRun here pretty baby set down on your daddy's knee
I want to tell everybody how you've been sending me
Now if that's your secret you can keep it to yourself
'Cause if you tell me I might tell somebody else

Because a lovin' proposition will get somebody killed
Lead me pretty baby 'cause you know I can be led
Squeeze me pretty baby until my face turns cherryredGet outta that bed wash your face and hands
Get outta that bed wash your face and hands
Well you get in that kitchen make some noise with the pots 'n pans

I believe to my soul you're the devil and now I know
I believe to my soul you're the devil and now I know
Well the more I work the faster my money goes
I said shake rattle and roll shake rattle and roll
Shake rattle and roll shake rattle and roll
Well you won't do right to save your doggone soul

Well I can look at you till you ain't no child no more
Ah shake rattle and roll shake rattle and roll
Shake rattle and roll shake rattle and roll
Well you won't do right to save your doggone soul
I get over the hill and way down underneath
I get over the hill and way down underneath
You make me roll my eyes even make me grit my teeth
I said shake rattle and roll shake rattle and roll
Shake rattle and roll shake rattle and roll
Well you won't do nothin' to save your doggone soul
Shake rattle and rollI've flown around the world in a plane
I've settled revolutions in Spain
And the North Pole I have charted
Still I can't get started with you
On the golf course I'm under par
Metro Goldwyn have asked me to star
I've got a house a showplace
Still I can't get no place with you
Cause you're so supreme
Lyrics I write of you I dream
Dream day and night of you
And I scheme just for the sight of you
Baby what good does it do
I've been consulted by Franklin D
Greta Garbo has had me to tea
Still I'm brokenhearted
Cause I can't get started with youI wake up every morning
Honey with the risin' sun
I wake up every morning
Baby with the risin' sun
Thinkin' about my honey dripper
And all the wrong she's done
When you see my baby
Tell her I said hurry home
If you see my baby
Tell her I said hurry home
I ain't had no real good lovin'
Since my gal been gone
She's a little bitty girl
And they call her Vita Lee
She's a little bitty girl
And they call her Vita Lee
Well the poor girl's gone
But she sure was good to me
I don't mind cryin' baby
But I hate to sleep all by myself
Don't mind cryin' baby
But I hate to sleep all by myself
Well the little girl I'm in love with
She's lovin' somebody elseShe wears loafer shoes a dungaree
Red jacket shirt if you please
My boogie woogie boogie woogie boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean my boogie woogie country girl
Now she digs that music with a beat
Rock 'n' rollin' is her need
My boogie woogie boogie woogie boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean my boogie woogie country girl
On Saturday night she comes to town
She plays the jukebox let her hair hung down
My boogie woogie boogie woogie boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean my boogie woogie country girl
Let 'em roll
She digs some cherries she can milk a cow
Don't like squares though daddy taught her how
My boogie woogie boogie woogie boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean my boogie woogie country girl
She's up every mornin' about half past five
She likes to go fishin' 'cause it keeps you alive
My boogie woogie boogie woogie boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean my boogie woogie country girl
Now when she's dancin' the kids hang around
They dig my baby 'cause she really goes to town
My boogie woogie boogie woogie boogie woogie country girl
Oh you dig what I mean my boogie woogie country girl
Yeah swing it man I like a good rockin' band
Yeah we need to knock aknockin'
And I love to rock arockin'
Yeah my boogie boogie woogie country girl
Early in the m'ning yeah
Yeah come to me mama hold me in your arms
Boogie woogie boogie woogie boogie woogie country girl
Play it man oh
Yeah rock it
Now dig that boogie boogie
Boogie woogie boogie woogie boogie woogie country girlVerse 1
Another night sitting outside by myself
Thinking of you pretending that you were in love with me
And I know I'll probably never even have a chance
It was stupid of me to think you want to be with someone who gave a damn
Chorus
I'm sick of being nice doing what you want
Just to hear you talk about him When it's plain to everyone
I am in love with you and he screws everyone around him
Verse 2
Maybe it's not your fault I just needed someone to blame for all my pain
I hate my friends I hate my family and I hate my job
Bridge
But you said you cared that cold night in November
when nobody was around
You said that you love me but now you cant remember
I guess it wasn't meant to beverse 1 Whisper sweet little nothings in my ear
tell me all the things I want to hear and let me know
you love me so and that you'll never let me go
chorus I don't care if the stars don't shine because your mine
and every day is just like valentines
verse 2 Let's go out on a starry night lay a blanket down
hold me close we'll watch the world spin round and as the stars look down
they will see you and me kissing softly

I wanna do all the things that you've dreamed of
I wanna hold you forever because we're so in love
chorus 1X just like valentines just like valentines all yearverse 1 There's no more laughter and no more cheer
I cant be happy if your not here
I want a white christmas but it's blue
I cant stop thinking about you
There's only one present under my tree
And it's addressed to you from me
I even did the wrapping job myself
You gotta remember it's the thought that counts
Chorus I've been good all year
Santa hear my cry
Grab your eight reindeer
And bring her to this guy
Verse 2 I hung your stocking by the christmas tree
and the one that you made for me
Come by there's something you need to bring
and it wont even cost a thing
There's only one thing I could think of
All I want is your love
I even made your favorite Christmas treat
Those santa cookies that you love to eat

And did you ever notice when I stutter every now and then

And I know this sounds like just another tune

Chorus Gary dont get angry
I didnt mean to break your heart
Gary I am sorry that we grew apart

and I waved goodbye

This ride is going way too fast

Because I swear to God the way you look at me sometimes

Hello 24 24 *french*

20 a boss
My 92' Honda my 92' Honda

Used to pick you up you was arguing with your mama
I don't like you friends cause they always with the drama
Baby I've been focused tryna get to the commas
All these niggas hating but really that's common
Rolling up weed I used to listen to your problems
And I don't pillow talk but girl you have problems
Me and you probably did for lunch
And I ain't have much but you can have what you want
I told that I love you and you played with my heart
I was super young so I really wasn't smart

You remind me of my Honda my 92' Honda
I was really in love with you my 92' Honda
You could had the world girl my 92' Honda
But now I'm driving 'Raris and I got a Barbie
You my 92' Honda my 92' Honda

I've been Saint Laurent shopping
20 got it popping
And we ain't talked in a long time
You gotta wait in a long line
Cause now I got issues
Talking big money problems
I'm barely talking to my mama
I swear that I've been working
But God got a plan for me
You used to be my family
We used to have matching Jordans
I used to tell you I'm recording
You used to say you didn't give a fuck
And now you hit your line back

My 92' Honda my 92' Honda
My 92' Honda my 92' Honda
I used to be in love with you
I used to be in love with you
But you just played me girl
But you just played me girl
My 92' Honda my 92' Honda
And now I got a Barbie
20 push a 'Rari
My 92' Honda my 92' HondaThe radio is loud and wild
And I'm too drunk to spin the dial
Bathe my bones in alcohol
So I don't have to think at all
I was born at the bottom
But I never belonged
I'm hardly ever right
But I've never been wrong
I can't get calm
Amplifiers sting my teeth
And batter me with evil things
I take some drugs to fix my brain
They numb my tongue but miss the pain
I was born at the bottom
But I never belonged
I'm hardly ever right
But I've never been wrong
I got dust in my lips and a limp in my charm
But got a halo on my heartPlay it loud
Play it fast
Play me something that will always last
Play it tough
Play it quiet
Play me something that might save my life
We're not lost we are dying in style
We're not fucked we are fucking alive
I hope I never die
Stick your heart on your sleeve
If it breaks stitch it on to me
Bash it back into shape
You might be cracked but I won't let you break
We're not lost we are dying in style
We're not fucked we are fucking alive
I hope you never die
A generation waits to bleed
For broken kids no one needs
There is heaven in these streets
There is heaven in these streets
I'm with you
Are you with me
We're not lost we are dying in style
We're not fucked we are fucking aliveWhen I die
Bury me in the clothes of my youth
Throw my dust in the streets
Where I got alive with you
Blurry eyes
Steady teeth
Another drink
A new bruise
On my heart or on my cheek
It's heaven
We stumble out or try
Loud and free
Raw and wild
And feel alive
I don't mind
Well I don't think
That hell is cheap and I'm loose
All my thrills come real cheap
But I swear my aim is true
We stumble out or try
Loud and free
Raw and wild
And feel aliveThis crummy town
Is filled with wild boredom
A battleground
Rumbling like a wardrum now
It gave us guts
It made us saints of danger
It woke us up
It made write to save us
The gutter's alive
With young hearts tonight
The gutter's alive
With young hearts tonight
The nothing kids
The restless and forgotten
We never fit
It's been our bravest weapon
The gutter's alive
With young hearts tonight
The gutter's alive
With young hearts tonight
It made us saints of danger
It made us saintsMy heart is set on '77
Wild nights and porno mouths
Won't die so I don't need heaven
I'm too fucked up to burn out
I'm an atom bomb ticking
I'm a deadend kid in the city
Dirty thoughts in a dirty town
I was born with trouble in me
I don't care why or how
I'm an atom bomb ticking
I'm an atom bomb
Come smear your lips on my bruises
Wake me up wear me out
Let's get free numb and loose
And kiss me with holy sound
I'm an atom bomb tickingYour eyelashes shine like a
Plastic diamond
Your arms are a car crash
I want to die in
Your lips smash in mine just like
Lust and violence
Your heart's marvelous trash
The world's forgotten
I can't love you raw enough
I can't love you raw enough
I can't love you raw enough
I can't love you raw enough
Your mouth mumbles wild like a
Pile of sirens
Your art is a loud bash of
Teenage feelings
If you're ready I'm in
I can't love you raw enough
I can't love you raw enough
I can't love you raw enough
I can't love you raw enoughPlease don't die before I do
Or say you'll take me with you
Deal
You're my favorite weirdo
How'd you teach me how to
Feel
I'd always tried
I kiss your mouth to taste your spit
And sip your words until they
Stick
I wrap them around my hands
And wear my palms like boxing
Mitts
Too soft to fight
I still taste you in the ash
Of every cigarette you kill
Have they dragged you back to life
If not yet
They never will
Carve 'I want you' in my arm
Cover up my sins with truth
If you stop being alive
Baby take me with youMake a muscle with your brain
You're not as broken as you are brave
All the things that fuck you up
Knock them out and then come back to us
Tonight could be the roughest of your life
I know you'll wake dying to survive
Don't be afraid to want to be alive
Splatter warpaint on your cheek
Bear your heart without apology
Hang your anger cut it loose
Make this stick I won't give up on you
Tonight could be the roughest of your life
I know you'll wake dying to survive
Don't be afraid to want to be alive
Knock the pills out of your teeth
The way they're kissing you
Gives me the creeps
Make a fist and ditch your doubts
I know you'll die some time
But it's not now
Tonight could be the roughest of your life
I know you'll wake dying to survive
Don't be afraid to want to be aliveThe words I scream
Are meaningless or holy things
They kiss my tongue
Before they split to fix someone
When nothing's loud
I punch my heart I flex my mouth
Until it comes
On like a truth
Brilliant and dumb
Man they taught me to talk
Then told me to shut up
I never cared
But man it cut
I'm nothing clean
I'm garbage thoughts and dirty knees
A fuckedup punk
I'm a bastard light I ain't no one's sonI'm gon' put it out there
Lay it on the line
And even if it breaks my heart
I'm giving it a try
Not waiting for tomorrow
Confessing it today
So baby here it goes
I'm out of time
It's do or die
I wanna be your baby
Wanna be your man
I wanna be your soldier
When you're too weak to stand
I wanna be your baby
Be the end of your day
Forever in your life
And ever by your side
Forever I'll stay
I'm hanging on a thread here
I don't care if I fall
But I ain't gonna foe
Even though
I don't know
If you feel me at all
I'm ready to be right or wrong with you
I'm ready for my heart to win or lose
I'm ready to give all I've got to you
Girl I want you to know
I wanna be your baby
Wanna be your man
I wanna be your soldier
When you're too weak to stand
I wanna be your baby
Be the end of your day
Forever in your life
And ever by your side
Forever I'll stay
So I'm saying I love you
Ain't holding nothing back
And I'm saying I want you babe

Forever I'll stay
I wanna be
I wanna be
I need to be
I got to beFor whatever might have been
And all that it never was
Whatever I couldn't see
for all that I didn't want
There was a method to my madness girl
That wasn't clear to me
Until the day I saw your face
When I saw everything
For I saw us dancing through sunshine and rain
And I saw us laughing through joy and through pain
And I saw time passing but we did not change
And I still saw us together at the end of every day

Whenever you want it
Whenever you need it
Whatever you feel like it's gon' be like
You better believe it
Whenever you feel like dancing
You don't have to dance alone no
You know you know you know
You should already know
I choose you 
I felt you inside myself
Before I could even feel
I knew you like no one else
But still I couldn't tell Oh
Girl none of it made sense to me
Girl none of it was real
Until the day I saw your face
And it was clear to see
Whenever you want it no
Whenever you need it no
Whatever you feel like it's gon' be like
You better believe it 
Whenever you feel like dancing
You don't have to dance alone no 
You know you know you know
You should already know
I choose you 

Throughout our times people have searched their lives
Hoping that they might find the chance where they can make things right
Through my desire thank God I found the fire
Oh for everything has led me straight to you 
Whenever you want it
Whenever you need it
Whatever you feel like it's gon' be like
You better believe it
Whenever you feel like dancing
You don't have to dance alone no
You know you know you know
You should already know
I choose you 
I choose you Some people wait for a life time
Waiting for dreams to come true
But sometimes all our dreams just dont happen
And that makes you feel like
Like nothing can work out right for you
But then again I got you in my life
Im good with that coz nothing can come between us
At least I got one thing right
And thats a fact coz there aint no there to see
It reminded me of something to hold on to
While I dont need something coz I got you
Thats how we get right
Chorus
All you need is one good thing that makes you happy
One good thing that lifts your heart
One good thing that makes the difference
Thats more than enough if it makes you happy
Sometimes you get just what you wish for
Whatever you want whatever you say
But somehow you still feel like something's missing
Lord knows I looked everywhere else
Now I look inside myself

Should I even listen
Should I even try
Will I just be hearing the same old lines
See it doesn't matter
What you say this time
'Cause our whole relationship
Is built on one lie
You say things aren't the way they seem
But still you can't come straight with me
How can you think that you're in love
When you don't know the meaning of
Love shoulda brought you
Brought you
Home last night
You shoulda been with me
Shoulda been right by my side
If you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you
To me last night
Gotta hand it to you
You had me there for a while
I was so in love with you
I couldn't see past your smile
Now I smell the coffee
Boy I got a wake up call
And it left the message
That you just don't care at all
You can't expect me to
Believe that she doesn't mean anything
You say that you love only me
Your kinda lovin' my darling
I just don't need
HOOK
Then you woulda been sincere
And I wouldn't be in tears
And love woulda brought you
To me last night
Oh baby why
Why do men think that love's just for the moment
Not over time
Please tell me why
Why should I think that
You're gonna be sincere
Are you deservin'
Don't blame me if
I just don't believe
I just don't believe
That you'll always be here
HOOKYeah wish I told her how I feel
Maybe she'd be here right now
But instead
I pretend that I'm glad you went away
These four walls close in more everyday
And I'm dying inside and nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
Now I'm cryin' inside and nobody knows it but me
Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just tumblin' down
I can see it so clearly but you're nowhere around
The nights are lonely the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you and nobody knows it but me
I carry a smile when I'm broken in two
Now I'm nobody without someone like you
I'm tremblin' inside and nobody knows it but me
I lie awake it's a quarter past three
I'm screamin' at night as if I thought you'd hear me
Yeah my heart is callin' you and nobody knows it but me
How blue can I get you could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle its been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know I'll be lovin' you still
The nights are lonely the days are so sad

And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you and nobody knows it but me
Tomorrow morning I'll hit the dusty road
Gonna find you wherever ever you might go
I'm gonna unload my heart and hope you come back to me

The nights are lonely

The days are so sad

And I just keep thinkin' about
The love that we had

And I'm missin' you

And nobody knows it but me

The nights are lonely the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you and nobody knows it but meIts not about who's right or who's wrong

I'm stayin here with some friends and they've got lots of room
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
By this cafe club I hope to be workin' soon
Please come to Boston she said no
But you come home to me

Hey ramblin' boy now you can settle down
Boston ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee
Please come to Denver with the snowfall
We'll move up into the mountains so far where we can't be found
And throw I love you echoes down the canyon
And then lie awake at night til they come back around
Please come to Denver she said no

Hey ramblin' boy why dont you settle down

And I doubt if it's ever gonna stop
But of all the dreams I've lost or found
And all that I ain't got
I still need to cling to
Somebody I can sing to
Please come to LA to live forever
Cause California life alone is just too hard to deal
I live in a house that looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars that fell from the sky livin' up on the hill
Please come to LA she said no
But you come home to me
And she said
Hey ramblin' boy why dont you settle down

Chorus till fadeAnother day or so he'd be one year older
God bless his soul
Nearly 18 years old when he became a soldier
God bless his soul
It's not like he didn't know
The way that things could go
Hope was all he had to cope
But he never made it home
I hope and pray
That when God called his name
He did not die in vain
I'd like to think he died for you and me
And I hope one day
When we look back again
And he's just a memory
That we'll appreciate respect the life he gave
In another year or so she might have been a mother
God bless her soul
But she'll never get to hold her baby girl I know her
God bless their souls
It's not like she didn't know
The way that things could go
Hope was all she had to cope
But she never made it home
I hope and pray
That when God called her name
She did not die in vain
I'd like to think she died for you and me
And I hope one day
When we look back again
And she's just a memory
That we'll appreciate respect the life she gave
And I hope and pray
That when God called their name
That they did not die in vain
I'd like to think that they died for you and me
And I hope one day
When we look back again
And they're just a memory
That we'll appreciate respect the life they gave
Respect the life they gave
Respect the life they gaveHow can I forget about the day I first met you
The way you walked in to the room with so much attitude
Sometimes people go through life
Searching for a sign

See from head to toe

Outside in inside out you do it for me ya knock me out a sight to see from

Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel
Things are gonna be just fine if you only will
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel
Things are gonna be much better if you only will
You can run but you cannot hide
This is widely known
And what you plan to do with your foolish pride
When you're all by yourself alone
Once you tell somebody the way that you feel
You can feel it beginning to ease
I think it's true what they say about the squeaky wheel
Always getting the grease
Better to shower the people you love with love
 show them the way that you feel
 Things are gonna be just fine if you only will

Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel
Things are gonna be much better if you only will
Shower the people you love with love

Sunday morning uh
Still my boo still My booI found her diary underneath a tree
And started reading all about me
The words she's written took me by surprise
You'd never read them in her eyes
They said that she had found
The love she waited for
Wouldn't you know it
She wouldn't show it
And when confronted with the writing there
She simply pretended not to care
I passed it off as just in keeping with
Her usual disconcerting air
And though she tried to hide
The love that she denied
Wouldn't you know it
She wouldn't show it
And as I go through my life
I will give to her my wife
All the sweet things I can find
I found her diary underneath a tree
And started reading all about me
The words began to stick and tears to flow
Her meaning now was clear to see
The love she waited for
Was for someone else not me
Wouldn't you know it
She wouldn't show it
And as I go through my life
I will wish for her his wife
All the sweet things she can find
All the sweet things they can findwritten by Babyface Daryl Simmons

You're not in control when there's demands put on your heart
You don't even know cause when it's real you fall too hard
And yet even so you try to play like nothing's wrong
No you can't run away there is no hiding place
'Cause you can't run from your heart
Your eyes they tell me secrets that you you can't deny
Your eyes they show me feelings that you hold deep inside
How do I know the secrets that you try to hide
'Cause when I look in your eyes
The truth is a lie
I knew you'd be mine
So now that it's on it's time to face reality
It's time to be strong take all your insecurities baby
Don't be afraid you gotta let your feelings flow
No you can't run away there is no hiding place
You gotta be true to your heart
HOOK
Now that you're all turned out
Don't you just love the way that it feels yeah
Yeah
Now you can't do without my love and you know that's for real
Now why you deny yourself i will never never never understand
Because i love you and you love me too
And that's just the way that it is yeah
HOOK to fadeIt's late in the evening
She's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her makeup
And brushes her long blond hair
And then she asks me
She says Do I look all right
And I say Yes girl
You look wonderful tonight
We go to a party
And everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
Is walking around with me
And then she asks me
She says Do you feel alright
And I say Yes
I feel wonderful tonight
I feel wonderful
Because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize
How much I love you I love you I love you
It's time to go home now
And I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys
And she helps me straight to bed
And then I tell her
As I turn off the light
Said My darlin'
You were wonderful tonight
Said My darlin'
You were wonderful tonightYeah wish I told her how I feel
Maybe she'd be here right now
But instead
I pretend that I'm glad you went away
These four walls close in more everyday
And I'm dying inside and nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
Now I'm cryin' inside and nobody knows it but me
Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just tumblin' down
I can see it so clearly but you're nowhere around
The nights are lonely the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you and nobody knows it but me
I carry a smile when I'm broken in two
Now I'm nobody without someone like you
I'm tremblin' inside and nobody knows it but me
I lie awake it's a quarter past three
I'm screamin' at night as if I thought you'd hear me
Yeah my heart is callin' you and nobody knows it but me
How blue can I get you could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle its been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know I'll be lovin' you still
The nights are lonely the days are so sad

And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you and nobody knows it but me
Tomorrow morning I'll hit the dusty road
Gonna find you wherever ever you might go
I'm gonna unload my heart and hope you come back to me

The nights are lonely

The days are so sad

And I just keep thinkin' about
The love that we had

And I'm missin' you

And nobody knows it but me

The nights are lonely the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you and nobody knows it but meVerse 1
I met a boy some years ago
And gave to him my heart
I felt like he was part of me
He made me smile
He made me laugh
His kisses were so sweet
He was the first for me
He became my everything
And then one day he came to me
And said that he had to go
And the saddest thing is that
I didnt know
Chorus
That you didnt love me
I didnt know
So what was I thinking
When I gave my heart and soul
I wish I could hate you
But probably wont
Inspite of everything its clear
You still mean the world to me my darling dear
Youll always be my first
My sugar
Yes you will

Verse 2
I fell in love the moment that
I first layed eyes on you
Seems God was watching over me
You took my heart and made it yours
Said You belong to me
Thats when I gave you me
And I gave you everything
And then one day you came to me
And said that you had to leave
And the saddest thing is that
I couldnt see
Chorus
That you didnt love me boy
I didnt know
So what was I thinking
When I gave my heart and soul
I wish I could hate you
But probably wont
Inspite of everything its clear
You still mean the world to me my darling dear
Youll always be my first

Never thought you would break my heart
I knew youd never hurt me
And then one day you came to me

My eyes can't lie to you
My kiss my kiss can only tell you true now
You say you have your doubts
But I say I don't know what that talks about now
My world I have given you
I never gave myself the way I gave myself to you
What have I gotta do to make you believe I love you
What have I gotta say to make you believe you're the one for me
Chorus
Didn't you hold me last night
Didn't you look in my eyes
Didn't I didn't I say what's in my heart
Didn't my heart tell you true
That I could only love you
Didn't I didn't I say what's in my heart
When I say I love you I say what's in my heart
Verse 2
There is no other love
I know that God knows you're the only one so
Why can't you believe when I tell you
There ain't nobody
There ain't nobody
But you in my heart
Long as we've been together
You should know by now the love I feel I feel forever
What have I gotta do to make you believe I love you
What have I gotta say to make you believe you're the one for me

Didn't you hold me last night
Didn't you look in my eyes

Didn't you hold me last night
Didn't you look in my eyes

Verse 1
Sometimes I sit at home
And wonder how it'd be
If he had loved me
Truly loved me yes
I learned a while ago
The kind of thing
Never happens for me
And so I go around
And just pretend
Love is not for me

I play the circus clown around my friends
Make them laugh and they won't see
That you never let them see you sweat
Don't want them to think the pain runs deep
Lord knows it's killing me
Chorus
So I put on my makeup
Put a smile on my face
And if anyone asks me
Everything is okay
I'm laughing 'cause no one
Knows the joke is on me
'Cause I'm dying inside
With my pride and a smile
On my face
On my face
Sing it lala la

Sometimes I sit at home
By the phone
Hoping he might call me

But he don't call me

But then I realize
Dreams come true
Aren't for girls like me
Not like me
Bsection 2
And so I go around with my head up
Like it ain't no thing
And when the boys around with all my friends
I'm into other things
Because you never let them see you sweat
Don't want them to think the pain runs deep
Lord knows it's killing me
Chorus
And so I put on 
Put it on put it on

But what else can I do
If he don't love me no
If he don't want me

Let myself

Go

Said I'm missing you like crazy baby all the time

Couples walking hand in hand looking mighty glad
Every time I think of you the tears appear
Got a broken heart baby 'cause I need you near
Said I'm feeling kind of lonely and I got a broken heart
And I don't know what to do 'cause we're so far apart
Said I'm feeling kind of lonely and my heart is torn away
And no one's going to keep us apart yeah

And Mom had to wipe away your tears
You asked her Why Dad isn't here

You say What come every day of the week
But she answers you with Why Go back to sleep
Your heart tells you something has changed
Why they've been acting so strange
Well I'm here to tell you you don't have to fear
Cause your daddy loves you I'm not going nowhere
And I won't give you up not gon walk away
When it comes to you and I nothing's gonna change
I'm here to tell you you don't have to be scared
I'm not going no I'm not going nowhere
Its true that I live in a whole different house
But that doesn't mean that I won't come around

We'll still make time to hang out
I promise I won't let you down
Well I've got a room with your name on the door
Your favorite things you could ever ask for
Then best of all if you cry out at night

Someone to help dry your eyes
Well I'm here to tell you you don't have to fear
Cause your daddy loves you I'm not going nowhere
And I won't give you up not gon walk away
When it comes to you and I nothing's gonna change

I feel so helpless cause Im so in love with you
Life is never simplelove aint no walk in the park
But how am I gonna end thing if I never get to startEach day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself you're such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
out of all the fellows in the world she belongs to me
But it was Just my imagination
once again runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me Oo
Soon we'll be married and raise a family 
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three
I tell you I can visualize it all
this couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems
But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord Hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die
Her love is heavenly when her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody but in reality she doesn't even know me
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me
no no no no no no no can't forget her
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with meAll I Think About Is You

Verse 1
Ive been searching for someone
Someone who could show me love
I never knew what love could do
Until the day the day I met you
And in my search I found a love
The kind of girls like me dream of
And now I thank my lucky stars each day
Ive been so blessed ever since you came my way
Chorus
And all I keep thinking about is you
You make my dreams come true
Long as the sky is blue

All I keep thinking about is you
You make me feel brand new
I wanna share this love
Feel so wonderful
And I owe it all to you
Verse 2
When I was scared and all alone
My best friend called me on the phone
And said Dont be afraid it wont be long
You just keep the faith and keep holding on
And then you came into my life
And suddenly my road seems so right
I never knew what love could do
And Im so glad I wished for you
Chorus
And all I keep thinking about is you
You make my dreams come true
Long as the sky is blue

All I keep thinking about is you
You make me feel brand new
I wanna share this love
Feel so wonderful
And I owe it all to you

Not being romantic
How could I let you fall out love

Turn back the hands of time
A time when I was yours
A time when you were mine

Im still in love with you

To fell this empty space in my heartbaby
I still have thoughts of you
Of making love to you
And taking sweet long walks in the parkbaby
So how do I convince you to come back to my arms
To my heart

For not understanding
You needed love and nothing else
Silly mesillysilly me
Silly me for loving you
And never complementing
Or feeling youthat you are my heart

There is nothing there for me
And all this love I feel inside
Cant put no arms around me
I wish that I could take it back
Turn back the hands of time
A time when I was yours
A time when you were mine


Mustve been silly of meto think that you would be
The kind of girl to take my shit
And not say one damn thing
Mustve been too blind to seeor just not listening
To what your heart was trying to say
I only pushed your heart away
Wasnt silly of meIt came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold
Peace on the Earth could will two men
From Heaven's allgracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing
And I hear them singing
Sing I do hear them singing
The first noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Born is the King of Israel
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far

With a plate of food
And at the door step darlin'
I left the keys for you
And I'll hold my tongue if that is your request yes
We'll just take our time and talk
No arguments

Though it just might seem
Alittle farfetched
That we could work things out well
Well I still believe that
That we'll make amends yeah
There's one thing for certain
We could use some happiness
We've been through it enough my friend
Chorus
It will break my heart
To see you go
I'd rather die than live alone
I don't wanna go nowhere
And meet somebody new
I'd rather spend my time

Verse 2

Of all the good things about us

Ooh oohSo many years that you sacrificed
So many chances you let go by
And girl never once did
you complain no way
And now he's got nerve just to criticize
You let yourself go like you've got no pride
You do what you do hoping he will stay
The first thing you do is put on your make up
But he doesn't notice a thing
It's not how it's s'posed to be
When men grow old
Do they lose sensitivity
When men grow old
They forget how to love
When men grow old
They have no sense of loyalty
Well if that's how it is
I don't want to grow anymore
So many nights when you sat alone
He's out with his friends like he's got no home
But you understood that he needed his space
But now it seems like that he's always gone
And he won't admit that
there's something wrong
He finds a young girl who will take your place
The first thing you do
you go get your hair done
But he doesn't notice a thing
It's not supposed to be that way

Time after time
Year after year
So many women are drowning in tears
Waiting and hoping and praying for love
Something that most men don't
know the true meaning of
Why can't they just open their hearts
don't they fall in loveIf I could save time in a bottle
The first thing that I'd like to do
Is to save every day 'til eternity passes away
Just to spend them with you
If I could make days last forever
If words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
Again I would spend them with you
But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with
If I had a box just for wishes
Dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty except for the memory
Of how they were answered by youMama take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore
It's gettin' dark too dark to see
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Mama put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
A long black cloud is comin' down
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door

Love never came between us
For love was too deep in our hearts
It's the silly things we do between us
That managed to tear us apart
But oh I believe if we work real hard
We can get through through it this time
Girl just trust me and I will trust you
There'll be nothing that we can't get through

I love you babe
In the scariest way
I want you babe
To stay with me
I love you babe
Though I'm hurtin' to say
I want you babe
To stay with me
I love you babe
In the scariest way
I want you babe
To stay with me
I love you babe
Though I'm hurtin' to say
I want you babe
To stay with me
Trust never came between us
And that's just the way that we are
It's the crazy things we do between us
That managed to break both our hearts
But oh I believe that we can survive
Through anything if we'd only try

She can roll roll with me
She can go go with me
Make me lose my mind
Almost every single time

Early evening conversation
Sharing how the day went down
Cancel dinner reservation
Cause I'd rather just hang out
Just the two of us
Sitting at home just watchin' movies
Or just be chillin' at the crib
Call up and order us some take out
Or maybe somethin' from the fridge
Then have some one on one
Sometimes we wake up too each other
Wrapped inside each others arms
Oh what I wish that we were lovers
But you don't want to go that far
That's not who you are
You wanna know what's in my heart
Then open your arms
It's the getting to know you
All about you
It's the thing I most desire
Getting to know you
Being around you
Turns the passion into fire
And I'm so alive
Everything I look into your eyes
I'm falling in love
Early morning conversation
Blowin' kisses through the phone
Knowing your thoughts before you say them
See I just called to say hello
Ain't it wonderful
The way I feel when we're together
Especially when you're in my arms
I can make love to you forever

Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon
Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon
Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night
Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon
Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon
Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon
Born to amuse to inspire to delight
Here one day
Gone one night
Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon
Gone too soonSomebody told me
There'd be trouble at home
'cause we never talk a lot
When we spend time alone
So how are we supposed to know
Know when something is wrong
Well we've got a right to communicate
It keeps a happy home
And no one does it like me
And no one but you
Has that kind of whip appeal on me
Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin' on me
Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin' on me
When we go to work
How the day seems so long
The only thing I think about
Can't wait 'til we get home
'cause we got a way of talking
And it's better than words
It's the strangest kind of relationship
Oh but with us it always works
And no one does it like me
And no one but you
Has that kind of whip appeal on me
Whatever you want
It's alright with me
'cause you've got that whip appeal
So work it on me
It's better than love
Sweet as can be
You've got that whip appeal
So whip it on me
Keep on whippin' on me

That he's been cheating on you
And that he treats you unkindly
He's using you
My friends tell me
That he keeps messing around
And that your love is so blinded
You think that it's it cool
Well he never sends you roses
He never kisses you goodnight
He never thinks about your anniversary
He says he don't have time
Well I might be wrong to think
A little bit confused
That a girl like you is too beautiful
For a guy like him to use

What ever happened to chivalry
What ever happened to love and true honesty
What ever happened to chivalry
What ever happened to love and true honesty
My friends tell me
That he's been bragging about
All of the girls that he's doing
All over town
My friends tell me
He's putting you down
And you're so in love you can't tell
He is turning you out
Well he never sends love letters
He never takes you out at night
He never wines and dines your heart
He says he don't have time
Well I might be wrong to think
A little bit confused
That a girl like you is too beautiful
For a guy like him to use
I ran into a friend of yours the other day
And I asked her how you've been
She said my girl is fine just bought a house got a job real good man
I told her I was glad for you that's wonderful
But does she ever ask 'bout me
She said she's happy with her life right now
Let her go let her be
And I told myself I would but something in my heart just would not let you go
I just want to know

What if we were wrong about each other
What if you were really made for me
What if we was 'sposed to be together
Would that not mean anything
What if that was 'sposed to be my house that you go home to every day
How can you be sure that things are better
If you can't be sure your heart is still here with me
Still wanting me
Your friend asked me if there was someone special in my life that I was seeing
I told her there was no one in particular
There's just I myself and me
I told her that I dream of you quite often
She just cut her eyes at me
She said you got a home you're very happy
So just stop your meddling
I told her that I won't
I said things were cool but I guess I was wrong
I still can't move on

Now that could be my car
That could be my house
That could be my baby boy that you're nursing
That could be the trash that I always take out
That could be the chair that I love to chill in
That could be my food on the table at the end of the day
Hugs and the kisses all the love we make
What the hell do you expect me to say
What if it's really 'sposed to be this way
What if you're really 'sposed to be with me
Here we go round and round and round
And back and forth you know
Everybody goes through it sometime
And that's just the way it flows
So we go up and down and up
And in and out the door
Even thought you know you've been through it before
For every argument that we've experienced
It's nice to know that you've remained composed
And I want to thank you for the chill in you
Especially for you being so cool
This for the cool in you
Cool in you cool in
This for the chill in you
Cool in you cool cool cool cool
This for you cool in you
Cool in you cool in
This for the chill in you
Cool in you cool cool cool cool
Looking on back at all the changes
That I put you through
Any other girl in your position
Shonuff would've been through
Thinkin' about how you made it easy
Always there for me
Never once did you turn your back and leave
For every tear you've cried I've cried a thousand times
Never once did I want you to hurt inside
I want to thank you for the chill in you
Especially for you being so cool
This is for the cool in you

You know a man likes a good time
He likes to wine and then dine
A beautiful woman
And love her thru the night
And if the lovin' feels right
He likes to do her two times
Pleasing that woman
Until she's satisfied
But when all the lovin's done
Who wants love that's on the run
One good time
But there's so much more
How 'bout conversation some communication
Someone who loves you and stimulates your mind baby
A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a woman
I need the kinda girl who keeps on
Using her mind all of the time baby
A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a strong woman who'll keep love comin'
All of the time all of her life
You know a man likes to have fun
He likes to get into some tender young roni's
As pretty as they come
He likes to love all night long
And makes 'em feel they got it goin' on
Sometimes it's lonely 'cause there's no one at home
But when all the peaks are done
No one still knows anyone
We've had fun but I need so much more
How 'bout conversation some communication
Someone who knows you and stimulates your mind baby
Hook
I'm not ashamed to say I've been that kinda guy
Didn't want no lady I just wanted a good time
But now I'm think I'm ready for
I need a woman that'll give it up
Someone to love me
And someone to be right by my side baby
Hook
Can you give me the lovin'
All I need
And if you give me the lovin' I'll give you all of mine
'cause I need a woman to care for me
To love me to squeeze me and someone to be right by my side
Baby
Hook 2 timesWhile all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else
Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids I have nothing to show
Wasted my years a fool of a wife
I shoulda have left your ass a long time ago
Well I'm not gon cry
I'm not gon cry
I'm not gon shed no tears
No I'm not gon cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
Well I'm not gon cry
I'm not gon cry
I'm not gon shed no tears
No I'm not gon cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears stood by your side
I shoulda left your ass a thousand times
Well I'm not gon cry
I'm not gon cry
I'm not gon shed no tears
No I'm not gon cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
Well I'm not gon cry
I'm not gon cry
I'm not gon shed no tears
No I'm not gon cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
I know there are no guarantees
In love you take your chances
But somehow it seems unfair to me
Look at the circumstances
Through sickness and health 'till death do us part
Those were the words that we said from our hearts
So now when you say that you're leaving me
I don't get that part
I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears stood by your side
I shoulda left your ass a thousand times
Well I'm not gon cry

Lately I've got this funny feeling
Something don't feel the same
But he's telling me I'm the one to blame
Yes I know that he still gives me good loving
But when he's deep inside
There's somebody else on his mind
Don't waste your time
But it gets so hard to know
Just walk away
You say that I got to let go
Seen it a million times before
You shouldn't take his stuff no more
Can't waste my time
Girl it's not hard to know
Should walk away
Oh you've got to let it go
Seen it million times before
Shouldn't take his sh** no more
Sister girl sister girl
It's much deeper than what you're thinking
When something don't feel the same
Yeah you better believe his love has changed

And what you're telling me

It ain't it ain't complete
He's got a sweetie on the side
Stop making truth out of his lies
Don't waste your time
But it gets so hard to know
Just walk away
You say that I got to let go
Seen it a million times before
You shouldn't take his stuff no more
Can't waste my time
Girl it's not hard to know
Should walk away
Oh you've got to let it go
Seen it million times before
Shouldn't take his stuff no more
What's the point of love
When you've got no trust
What's the point of staying
When you've seen enough
What's the point of giving
What he don't deserve
He don't deserve it
No you don't deserve it
Oh what's the point of feeling
Like there's nothing inside

Just out to break your heart
So baby don't fall apart
I know that it hurts sometimes
But girl if you let me ride

Nights all alone
Visions of you
Dancing with someone dressed in blue
Soft voice on the phone
Asking for you
How can I ignore such an obvious clue
Always workin' late
You don't even call
You never have time for no one
Maybe it's clear there's some girl dressed in blue
I just don't wanna believe it's true
Please tell me that I'm dreamin'
That you have not been sleepin' with her
The hours you been keepin'
They tell me you been sleepin'
With someone else
A kiss on the cheek
No kiss on the mouth
I love you's are down to nothin'
Ain't made love in weeks
You ain't been around
You got no desire for lovin'
We never go out

You used to make time for us dear

Sure I've been in love a time or two
But in the end I still chose you
No one could ever make me feel this way
That's why it's killing me what we're going through
Somehow thought 'tween me and you
Our love would stand the test of time and never ever fade
But we're not making love no more
We're not even trying to change
Tell me how it slips away
Does it ever stay the same
We don't even talk no more
We've ran out of words to say
Tell me it don't have to change
Won't it ever stay the same
Girl I know that things aren't going right
But don't you think it deserves a fight
A love like ours don't happen everyday
And we're losing it right as we speak
And if we don't wake up it's a memory
A time gone past a love that sailed away
Hook
I dream of lovers past and
I see a girl so sad 'cause
She lost the only man she loved
He went away
Well it's not too late for us
To change

Woe woe woe woe

Always thought your promise was for life
I did not think that i
Would hear you say goodbye
And I always heard you led another life
I doubted every time
I guess every time
'cause in my eyes
Love was always something magical
But the feeling is so tragic for
And all I know is in love
The thing that I want most
I can't possess
There's only emptiness
In the late of night
Just before I closed my eyes
You lied
As you kissed me goodnight
In the late of night
Just before I closed my eyes
I cried
As you kissed my lips goodbye
In my eyes
You will always be the lucky one
'cause you know you'll always have my love
For all time until I die
Through the end I gave to you my best
You gave you gave me lonelinessWritten by keith andes babyface marc nelson bryce wilson

You come to me with a casual flow
And suddenly my defences start to go
When you talk to me in that sensual tone
It envelops me and I lose my self control
And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Everytime I see your face I go off
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms
Imagining that your taking it slow
And so tenderly
'til the feeling overflows
When you look at me I go soft and cave in
And I can't conceal that I'm slowly weakening
Hook
You and me in a cloud of reverie
Spin around inside my head unendingly
Thoughts run wild as I sit and rhapsodize
Pretty pictures of what I'd do if you were mine

I toss and turn
Listenin' for the telephone
But when I get your call I'm all choked up
Can't believe you called my home
And as a matter of fact it blows my mind
You would even talk to me
Because a girl like you is like a dream come true
A real life fantasy
No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together any kind of weather
It's like that it's like that girl
Every little step I take you will be there
Every little step I make we'll be together
Every little step I take you will be there
Every little step I make we'll be together
I can't think too straight I'm all confused
You must've put a thing on me
Because there are no words that can explain
I'm living in ecstasy
And you can best believe I've got your back
You never have to feel no pain
Because I dedicate my life for you
You never have to love again

We were made to fall in love
We'll always be together any kind of weather

Every time I think
About the love we make
It makes my heart sink
Deep into my soul
Everywhere I go
I'm always thinking of
When we make love
Wanna go back to the day
When I touched you girl in every way
Gotta take the change to hear you say
That you want me girl
Girl you know you rocked my world
'cause
I can't eat can't sleep
You know that it's unnatural
What you do to me
You know that it's so sexual
What's come over me
Never thought that love could be so addicting
The feeling hurt so bad
It makes my body weak
I can taste you even when you're not with me
Look what you've done to me
Wanna go back to the day
When I touched you girl in every way

Love has many ways
Of touching your emotions
Taking control of you
And even in thought
Love can make you change
There's no way of taking control
When it's part of you
Well you could be a married man
With two kids and a good woman
And you could give your heart and soul
I swear it don't mean nothin'
Cause love can pull you deep into a spell
It will spin your mind around like a carousel
I'm tellin' you love
Boy makes things happen
You never know where it's coming from
You never know who you're gonna love
I'm telling you love makes things happen
You never know what you're gonna do
When ever true love takes hold of you
There's never a time
Cause love will let you know
Love appears at the worst and even the best of times
Takes over your mind
Your heart is not your own
There's no way of controlling love
It controls your life
Well you could be a faithful girl
With a good heart and good intentions
And you could never leave your home
I swear there ain't no preventions
Cause love can pull you deep into a spell
It will spin your mind around like a carousel

When love takes hold of you
You can have the purest heart
And the finest attitude

If I told you I'm crazy would you come running back to me
The harder I try to break away the more I get lost in yesterday
The man that you know is just a shell living without your life is hell
I turn on the radio just to take the hurt away
Another night and I'm missing you
Girl it's killing me well

I don't want to die tonight but I think I might be going down
'Cause the only one I ever cared about is nowhere to be found
I don't want to close my eyes 'cause I might not see the light of day
I'm almost out of air
You're my reason for breathing
You're my reason for breathing
I don't want to go clubbing I got no one to dance with me
I don't want to go shopping I got no one to spend my money on
Spending my time with one glass of wine
Playing solitaire just to ease my mind
Poured one for you but I drank that too
Anything to kill the pain of losing you
I turn on the radio just to take the hurt away
Another night and I'm missing you
Girl it's killing me

So I'm reaching out on this distant line
Hoping deep inside your heart's gonna find a reason
To keep me breathing
But I'm lost in this pain and I don't have much time
I'm so tired of walking this same old line
So I'm taking my pride gonna throw it aside
Please let me breathe girl I'm sorry

I fell for you
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past
One of the few
You said it didn't last
Now romeo you know I can't believe
Your tongue would slip so easily
I know you think I oughta let it be
But get it right next time
That's the end of me
My name is not susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't wanna hear about susan
She got nothin' on me
So show some respect
For the love you receive
Get it right
Last night you were asleep
Deep in a dream
I heard you call her name
Then you turned to embrace
I froze in place
Never to be the same
Now romeo you know I never knew
My heart would bust so easily
I know you think I oughta let it go
But get it right next time
Say goodbye to me boy

Hope he's lookin' at me
I was in love the moment that I saw you
I followed you thru the crowd and I almost lost you
I was dying to tell you but scared of your reaction
But I can't hold back because I'm rushed
With this thing called passion
You've got me knocked out
Turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out
Baby there's no doubt
You swept me off my feet
I walked your way hoping that maybe you'd noticed

Never did I think love could be so amazing

There lies a magic spark

And since the dawn of man
The strength of just i can
Has brought together people of all nations

There's a special part of every one of us we'll play
 feel the flame forever burn
Teaching lessons we must learn
To bring us closer to the power of the dream
As the world gives us it's best
To stand apart from all the rest
It is the power of the dream that brings us here
Your mind will take you far
The rest is just your heart
You'll find your fate is all your own creation
And every boy and girl
As they come into this world
They bring the gift of hope and inspiration

You'll discover that you can

Ne dejemos que muera el amor

Vivimos como extranos tu y yo
Apenas nos hablamos todo es discusion
Hay un vacio en el corazon
Seria demasiado un gesto de amor
Quizas una caricia pueda salvar la ilusion
No dejemos que muera el amor
Si en el fondo nos duele partir
No dejemos que muera el amor
No es possible la vida sin ti
Te necesito
A veces yo te veo llorar
Y se cuando el dolor no se puedo ocultar
Me debes una oportunidad
Si todo lo pasado no vuelve a pasar
Por que sequir sufriendo y no volver a empezar

We're going from Tahiti to France to Italy in one night
Drop top Bentley Coupe parked in the spotlight
And you can drive it laced in all white

Trips to Venice the man a steel when a menace
A match made in heaven when we blend this
Lovers everlasting in other words endless
To love any other man would be senseless in yor face
On the real was the honey looking laced

Ladies and gentlemen Howard Hewitt
I can say I never met a girl no no
Who satisfied my mental and my physical thing
When I lay me down to sleep

I call your heart but there's no one at home
Taking a toll on my pride
I'm reaching out but there's no one inside
You know it doesn't feel right
When I look in your eyes
I know love is blind but the heart doesn't lie
I'll ask one more time
Maybe this time you'll try
So tell me girl what's deep in your heart
Girl I care about you

So why don't you care for me
Like I care about you
Girl I care about you

Trying to sense out just how things got this way
I thought that we were in love
But I swear right now I don't know what you want babe
I make sure that I give you quality time
But lately I feel you're not home by design
But still I'm gonna try to give you the love of my life
In hopes that you that you will open up your heart baby

Cannot feel how we feel must pretend it's over
Must be brave and we must go on
Must not say what we've known all alone

I never asked for this feeling
I never thought I would fall
I never knew how I felt
Til the day you were gone
I was lost
I never asked for red roses
I wasn't looking for love
Somehow I let my emotions take hold
And guess what all at once
I'm in love
Oh I miss you so much
I long for your love
It's scares me
'cause my heart gets so weak
That I can't even breathe
How can you take things so easily
Baby why aren't you missing me
Why did I act like you mattered
It was silly of me to believe
That if I just opened my heart
Things would come naturally
Jokes on me 
I did not ask for love letters
So why did you give them to me
How could I let your intentions
Get hold over me
So in love
So naive oh baby

And oh how I hate what you have done
Made me fall so deep in love
Got no cure

Sometimes love can feel like
The closest thing to heaven
And sometimes love can feel like
You've been run over by a car
Yes it can
It's the strangest thing I know
Make you feel warm when you feel cold
And if you down on happiness
You better get used to the taste of sadness
'cause love can sure hurt sometimes
Love hurts and it don't
Love don't always work
Love ain't all it seems
It feels good but it stings
Love hurts and it don't
Some people will tell you
It's the best thing for the heart
Yes what they fail to tell ya
It can tear your life apart
But you know
It's as sweet as summer rain
But it can hit you like a train
Fill your heart with pain
Fill your heart with pain
Ooh everybody sing everybody sing
Hook
When you know that you're alive
'cause you feel so much
When you feel you can't survive
But you make it anyway
When it feels too good to stop
But it hurts too much to stay
Then you know yes you know
You gotta know love hurts
It hurts and it don't
Hookcan't believe I'm here
Down at the q's jook joint 
It sure is happenin' y'all 
But listening to this music
Kinda makes me think about when I used to listen to slow jams
Back in the day 
Like babyface whip appeal 
Or r kelly bump and grind
But you know what 
Sometimes when I'm just layin' down with my man 
I get the feelin' I need to hear a little barry white 
Show you right 
Then there are other times when I just need a little sexual healing
Of marvin gaye 

What about some teddy pendergrass 
Close the door and turn out the lights 
Feels so good baby yeah
Yes 
Yeah baby
 baby 
Baby oh yeah

Baby dim the lights
So while I pour the wine
Set the music up nice and slow
Wanna move with you inside a groove
Like no one's ever known
Let your body unwind and walk the mile
Tell me what you like
'cause tonite I wanna turn you up to paradise
Sweet thang hold me close
Share my desire
And we can make the magic flow
Once the music is rocking
Give me slow jams and hot romance
Rock me with that tender dance
Baby get closer so we can feel the power of love
Share my sweet groove the whole night through
Let me lay my beat on you
We'll keep the music playing movin' in time
Let me get a taste of some babyface
And you know it'll be alright
'cause the road that ends at boyz ii men
Is the road I wanna ride
We can go to the moon on a stevie tune
Fly ribbons in the sky
Give me everything r kelly sings
Let us bump and grind
Baby feel the beat
Here in my heart
Move with me in ecstacy
Let the melody start
Give me slow jams and hot romance
Rock me in that tender dance
I wanna feel the passion so give me all you got
Share my sweet groove the whole night through
Make tonight a dream come true
Let's keep this groove thing going and never never never let it stop

That when I give my heart
You'll give me your heart too
Could you learn to love someone
Could you teach your heart to love

Could you learn to love someone
Could you teach your heart to love
Tell me that you could do it

Why do summers start in june
Why do winters come too soon

Why springtime go away

Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy
You bring me joy you bring me joy you bring me joy
I used to think that love was a mischief
Something that a guy just could not figure out
As if I never had no fancy stuff
Not even a clue what true love was about
Until you came and made life worth living
Like the very first day of spring
I was so so anticipating
Girl I didn't know I had love inside of me
Love saw it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy

How will I know when someone loves me
How will I know if there's no one else
I'm dyin' to have someone who'll love me
But I want them to love me for myself
I looked for love in all the wrong places
I searched the moon and the stars
Found myself lost in a world of faces
The place I didn't look was my heart
I've been all around the world
Trying to find something new
Lord knows that something was you
'cause I found in myself
The one thing that's true
All I want is an ordinary girl
All I need is an ordinary girl
I just want someone I can talk to
Someone I can lean on now and then
I don't wanna lie and pretend I'm someone else
I'm just lookin' for a friend

I didn't know which way to turn
Just when I thought I had all of the answers
I found I still had so much to learn

When there are words unspoken
In your soul there's answers to your prayers
But if you're searching for
A place you know a familiar face
Somewhere to go
You should search inside yourself

Life never tells us the when's or why's

You'll find a point when you will exhale

'Cause I'm in love with you
Calling all cars

You were a typical girl
You came along and changed my world
I walk slow
You walk fast
Everybody said that it could not last
Love came inside of me
Never knew how good our love could be
Love caught it we thought
Why can't we be in love well

So do I so do I
So do I so do I
Oh so do I

WhyTonight I'm gonna hold you

I was searchin' for the perfect girl the woman of my dreams
And now she is in love with me

And I cry 'cause II can't believe
'Cause you just don't know the half of it
Or what it means to me
To have finally found the perfect girl
The angel of my dreams
And now she is in love with me
And even though I've been around the world

When u trust someone
And u know you're on their back
You ain't got no trustin' about you
And you claim that you don't care what where I'm at
You've given me reason to doubt you

To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go
To right to unrightable wrong
To love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star
This is my quest to follow that star
No matter how hopeless and no matter how far
To fight for the right without question or pause
To be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause
And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest
That my heart will be peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest
And the world will be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable starsWritten by la reid babyface

How could I throw away a miracle
How could I face another day
It's all of my doing I made a choice
And today I pay
My heart is full of pain
How could you understand the way I feel
How could you relate to so much pain
Seems as though nothing can comfort me
So today I pray
That someone should listen for
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
A voice of love is crying out
Don't throw love away
There's a miracle in store
How could I let go of a miracle
Nothing could ever take it's place
Thought I was looking out for myself
Now it seems the pain
Is all that I have gained
I wonder if I could be your miracle
I wonder if I could spare you pain
Seems as though nothing will comfort me
Lord less today I pray
That you should come listen
Hook
Don't ever throw away your miracle
Don't let it slip away

I never thought you were a fairweather friend
You never let me down you're true to the end
You're in the darkest hour when all was lost
Somehow you left the light on
You faced the wrong and showed the world a thing or two
Stood up for me for you
And you should know
Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through
I say it ain't worth losing you
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
Someday you'll see if only through heaven's eyes
Only through heaven's eyes
I still remember the things that you said
I keep your words alive I could never forget
'cause in the final hour you made me proud
So proud that I could know you
You told the world it's time that they believed in you
You stood for right and truth
And you should know
Hook
And so we can't forget
We've got to keep remembering them all
The ones who took the fall
They did it for us all
And we should learn from it
Stand up if you believe in it
You've got to face the world
Be strong

Sometimes I feel so alone
I call your heart
But there's no one at home
Taking a toll on my pride
I'm reaching out
But there's no one inside

I know love is blind but the heart doesn't lie
I'll ask one more time maybe this time you'll try
So tell me girl what's deep in your heart
Girl I care 'bout you
I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me
Like I care 'bout you
I spend like all of my days
Trying to cess out just how things got this way
I thought that we were in love
But I swear right now I don't know what you want
I make sure that I give you quality time
But lately I feel you're not home by design
But still I'm gonna try you're the love of my life
In hopes that you will open your heart

We fell in love and who could blame us
The word was we were just beside ourselves
And everybody said it wouldn't last
Now they wonder
Why we didn't last
We fell in love
It seemed so righteous
Couldn't compare our love to no one else
And everybody thought we could not win
It's no wonder
Love came to an end
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know
We fell apart
The bond was broken
Should've kept our thoughts between ourselves
And though they say they cared
They didn't help
Makes me wonder
Should we blame ourselves
So here we are
Broken hearted
What in the world have we done to ourselves
When everybody says to let it end
It makes me wonder
We can't let them win
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know
If we'd only just try we could make it by
And maybe in time we could make it right
If we only had done what we shoulda done
We'd both be here still making love
I want to know that that we can go back
Back to a time when the lovin' was all that
When no one could come between our love
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion

You so busy
Worryin bout
All of the thing you can to do nothing about
Maybe its time to change your route
Instead of pluggin in so much
You should look out
You have so many things to smile about
Like Love
For all the things you have ever dreamed
It could work out
So dont stress out 
It will happen if its meant to be
So dont stress out
Things could work out baby
We go round mmm
Only once
Dont waste you time not having fun
You should live your life its all you got
Like its always better to live than not

Is where you belong
Sunshine will defeat the storm
At the end of the day

So dont stress out

For the longest time I searched high above the sky to find the one for me
Sweet birds guided my limbs and told me it was purely destiny
A few clouds came my way and told me it was purely destiny
A few clouds came my way and suddenly came the break of day
And it was you only you then I gave my love to you
And I gave my love to you
And I gave my love to you
And my rivers flowed for you
And my rivers my sweet rivers flowed for you
Please don't tear my heart in two
Please don't tear my heart into two
As I gave my love to you
As I gave my love to you as I open wide for you
Sailing cautiously without knowing that my reality will soon come
Strong winds brought me from my high I drifted gradually from my ride
Touching down kissing ground it's you that I look for
Let's be two my baby as I gave my love to you
Hook
Tender lover blow your cover release emotions
For there's no other but us two
Give it to me and i'll I'll give it to you
Discover trust in my sweet caress
Female sunshine and nothing less
Just a touch from my hand and infinate warmth from my man
Yea gonna make you mine yea til the end of time
Cause I'm open wide with so little to do
Simply put I live my life for you
Give it to me and I'll give my love to you

Anything you want me to

My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
You looks are laughable unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
Are your looks less than greek
Is your mouth a little bit weak
When you open it to speak are you smart
Don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me

You ask my why I say why not
Anything is possible anything can be
Therefore tonight I'll get you hot
You'll feel a passion you never dreamed
And in a way you'll feel I'm overconfident
What kind of man could I be
It's clear to see it's like animal attraction
When you add it up it's just a matter of factions girl
Something in your eyes told me
That you were looking for a man you could adore
Something in your eyes had given me a sign
And I knew it was on I knew it was on
You think you're dry I say your wet
I can make it possible I can make it true
And all night long I'll make it sweat
Gonna do a feeling that long past overdue
And in a way you think why so much confidence
What kind of man must I be
It's clear to see it's like adding and subtracting
When you add it up it's just animal attraction
Hook 2 times
So when I get inside and make you wet
I'll lick you dry
Creamate your body we get from all the body heat
And like a lion you'll hear me roar
And when I feed it to your body
Make that body get weak some more
I'll take you to the peak
I'll make you wanna scream
And like a lion you'll hear my body
Roar and roar and roar and roar and roar
Hook 3 times
Anything is possible and anything can be
You can feel a passion you never dreamed of
See it in your eyes
You're givin' me a sign
And I knew it was on I knew it was on
It was something in your eyes that took me to feel it
Something in your eyes and hey I can see it
Something in your eyes had given me a sign
And I knew it was on I knew it was on

I'm having fun but all that I done
It hasn't always been right
They say I misuse that I break the rules
But that won't get me uptight
Now they're telling me what I can never be
And always tryin' to bring me down
But I'm so strong I'll prove them wrong
No matter what they say I'm telling you right now

And everything you've given me
I always keep it inside
You're the driving force in my life yeah
There isn't anything
Or anyone I can be
And it just wouldn't feel right
If I didn't have you by my side
You were there for me to love and care for me
When skies were grey
Whenever I was down
You were always there to comfort me
And no one else can be what you have been to me
You'll always be you always will be the girl

Me diste todo
Y mas que todo me ensenaste tu
Te llevo dentro de mi
Y tu fuerza me hace vivir si
Cuando a mi lado
No te siento ya no se quien soy
Ni se lo que voy a hacer
Todo sin ti me sale mal
Tu estuviste alli
En cada nube gris
Cuidandome
Y si una vez cai
Tu estuviste alli
Alzandome
Que nadie sabe amar nadie puede dar
Un carino asi
Y por siempre el gran amor
De mi vida eres tu
Mama
Mama te queiero tanto
Te quiero tanto tu sabes cuanto
Mama
Reina de mi vida eres tu
Ll uvia de una estrella es tu luz
Cuando estamos juntos los dos
Solo me alimenta tu amor
Conmigo siempre tanto al frente como tras de mi
Y si algo hice mal
Tu perdonaste mi error
Siempre asi
Y cuando otros me fallaron me enganaron tu
Me llegaste a salvar
A darme fuerza interior
A veces miro atras
Y alli mismo estas
Hablandome
Me dices ten valor
Y ya
Asi todo esta bien
Yo se que otra igual
Yo nunca encontrare
Ya nunuca mas
Pues el gran amor
Solo tu lo das

When no one was
Just when I thought nobody cared
You showed me love
'Cause you were my friend
You always told me
And I am still here

So precious small treasures
A time when truth was innocent
True friendship was all we were after
A place where kids could still be kids
And it hurts
But I'm glad
'Cause at least I was blessed
To have you as my friend
'Cause you were there
When no one was
Just when I thought nobody cared
You showed me love
'Cause you were my friend
You always told me
And I am still here
Because you were there
You're my best friend
There are no accidents
God has a plan for everyone
And he brought you in my life
To show me what a good friendship was

When no one was
Just when I thought nobody cared
You showed me love

Today I felt a pain inside my heart
The thought of leaving you was on my mind
If I've been deceiving you it's all because I'm blind
'cause I care for you more than you know
Although my heart says go
Today I saw the tears inside your eyes
The thought of hurting you I'd rather die
If I'm deserting you I don't mean to make you cry
'cause I care for you more than you know
Although my heart says
How do you tell the one
You love goodbye for good
Or even know if you should
And how do you say the words
You thought you never could
When you promised her
That you love was true
Said I'd never think of leaving you
Oh how can love be cruel
Today I felt a pain inside my heart
The thought of leaving you had crossed my mind
If I've been deceiving you it's only cause I'm blind

My heart has been broke in two
I kept on waiting in line
'cause nobody's heart was true
For every time I gave into love
I was always in the blue
And just when I was 'bout to give up
I found myself an angel called you
I've been waiting a lifetime for somebody
To love me like you do
Oh yeah 
I was thinking that I'd always be lonely
But God came up with someone like you
Just to think I had made up my mind
Love was over
Somebody gave me the love
That somebody was you
I tell you night after night
I prayed for someone like you
But no one ever was right
They could not compare to you

I was in love with you
And gave my heart to you
I did my best to keep you satisfied
You took the love from me
And used it selfishly
You did not give back your

You said it was too bright
I gave you diamond rings
You said they didn't shine

How could you just keep breakin' my heart
What did I do to you
To make you be so cruel

One thing left to say

And you've taken all you can bear
Just call me up
Because you know I'll be there
And I'll see your true colors
Shining through

And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Just show your true colors
True colors are beautiful

First thing monday morning
I'm gonna pack my tears away
Got no cause to look back
I'm lookin' for me a better day
You see the thing 'bout love
Is that it's not enough
If the only thing it brings you is pain
There comes a time when we could all make a change
Just let go
And let it flow let it flow let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right you know
Let go and let it flow let it flow let it flow
Just let it go
Don't nobody want no broke heart
And don't nobody want no two time losers
Ain't nobody gonna love you like you are
If you take whatever he brings your way
You see the thing of it
Is we deserve respect
But we can't demand respect without change
There comes a time when we must go our own way
Hook
Sometimes love it can work out right
Sometimes you'll never know
But if it brings only pain in your life
Don't be afraid to let it go
HookMaybe I hang around here
A little more than I should
We both know I got somewhere else to go
But I got something to tell you
That I never thought I would
But I believe you really ought to know
I love you
I honestly love you
You don't have to answer
I see it in your eyes
Maybe it was better left unsaid
This is must realize
That it's coming from my heart and not my head
I love you
I honestly love you
I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to make you anything at all
But this feeling doesn't come along everyday
And you shouldn't blow the chance
When you've got the chance to say
I love you
I honestly love you
If we both were born
In another place and time
This moment might be ending in a kiss
But there you are with yours
And here I am with mine
So I guess we'll just be leaving it at this
I love you
I honestly love you
I honestly love youWhen can my heart beat again
When does the pain ever end
When do the tears stop from running over
When does you'll get over it begin
I hear what you're sayin'
But I swear that it's not making sense
So when can I see you
When can I see you again
When can my heart beat again
When can I see you again
And when can I breathe once again
And when can I see you again
When does my someday begin
When I'll find someone again
And what if I still am not truly over
What am I supposed to do then
Please hear what I'm sayin'
Even if if it's not making sense
So when can I see you

Please hear what I'm sayin'
Even if if it's not making sense
So when can I see you

Everybody needs a little time away
I heard her say from each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away from each other
Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay
And after all that you've been through
I will make it up to you I promise you
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go
Couldn't stand to kept away
Not for a day from your body

Wouldn't wanna be swept away
Far away from the one that I love
Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know 
Hold me now
I really wanna tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go

I will make it up to you I promise you

I'll always think of you
Inside of my private thoughts
I can imagine you
Touching my private parts
With just the thought of you
I can't help but touch myself
That's why I want you so bad
Just one night of
Moonlight with you there beside me
All night doin' it again and again
You know I want you so bad
Baby baby baby
Oooh I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise
You're makin me high
Baby baby baby baby
Can't get my mind off you
I think I might be obsessed
The very thought of you
Makes me want to get undressed
I wanna be with you
In spite of what my heart says
I guess I want you too bad
All I want is
Moonlight with you there inside me
All night doin it again and again
You know I want you so bad

Hook 2 timesI heard he sang a lullaby
I heard he sang it from his heart
When I found out thought I would die
Because that lullaby was mine
I heard he sealed it with a kiss
He gently kissed her cherry lips
I found that so hard to believe
Because his kiss belonged to me
How could an angel break my heart
Why didn't he catch my falling star
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart
I heard her face was white as rain
Soft as a rose that blooms in May
He keeps her picture in a frame
And when he sleeps he calls her name
I wonder if she makes him smile
The way he used to smile at me
I hope she doesn't make him laugh
Because his laugh belongs to me
How could an angel break my heart
Why didn't he catch may falling star
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart
Oh my soul is dying it's crying
I'm trying to understand
Please help me
How could an angel break my heart
Why didn't he catch my falling star
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heartCalled me up on a Friday night
'Cause she knew you'd be out with ya girls
Said she always thought that I was fly
Me and her should maybe take a twirl
I told her girl no no no
But she still came knocking at my door
I told her to go go home
But that made her even want me more
And now she's busy trying to signify
That there was something going on between her and I

Dropped the crib early Tuesday night
'Cause she knew you'd be away at school
Tried to seduce me with all kinda lies
Tried to make me think the worst of you
I told her girl no no no
She dropped out and tried to give me a kiss
I told her to go go home
Then she said you gon' be sorry for this
And now she's out there trying to testify
That there is something going on between her and I

Take a bow
The night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low
The curtains are down
There's no one here

Say your lines
But do you feel them
Do you mean what you say
When there's no one around
Watching you watching me
One lonely star

I've always been in love with you
I've guess you've always known it's true
You took my love for granted why oh why
The show is over say goodbye
Say goodbye say goodbye
Make them laugh
It comes so easy
When you get to the part
Where you're breaking my heart
Hide behind your smile
All the world loves a clown

Wish you well
I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
No more masquerade
You're one lonely star

Hook
All the world is a stage
And everyone has their part
How was I to know
Which way the story'd go
How was I to know you'd break
You'd break you'd break you'd break
You'd break my heart

Performed by the deele
Out one night to seek a mate
I asked a stranger for a date
And guess what she said
I like her man was cool but i
Was sexier than any guy
She'd ever met
Maybe if I took a chance
To find a night of sweet romance
Love wouldn't be
Waiting for my ship to come
And catch this player on the run
I wanted to see oh her eyes
Her eyes were eyes of a stranger

Her eyes were filled with danger
She was such a pretty thang
Maybe that's why I was game
Walkin' the line
So we took a rendezvous
To satisfy each other's mood
Time after time
As I looked into her eyes
Wondering if they were disguised
A mystery to me 
All I felt was instant lust
Knowing it was dangerous
But I had to see oh her eyes
Her eyes were eyes of a stranger

Her eyes were filled with danger

Her eyes were eyes of a stranger

Her eyes were filled with danger
Her eyes on me
I feel her eyes on me
Her eyes were eyes of a stranger

Her eyes were filled with danger

Her eyes were eyes of a stranger

Her eyes were filled with danger
Her eyes on me
I feel her eyes on me
She's a mystery
Baby can't you see
She got me hypnotized
Baby mezmerized
Her eyes were eyes of a stranger
Her eyes were filled with danger
Her eyes were eyes of a stranger
Her eyes were filled with danger
Her eyes were eyes of a stranger
Her eyes were filled with danger
Her eyes were eyes of a stranger
Her eyes were filled with dangerFrom the moment I saw you I went outta my mind

She was oh so beautiful
But she's not here anymore
She had a college degree
Smart as anyone could be
She had so much to live for
But she fell in love
With the wrong kinda man
He abused her love and treated her so bad
There was not enough education in her world
That could save the life of this little girl
How come how long
It's not right it's so wrong
Do we let it just go on
Turn our backs and carry on
Wake up for it's too late
Right now we can't wait
She won't have a second try
Open up your hearts
As well as your eyes
She tried to give a cry for help
She even blamed things on herself
But no one came to her aid

If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember girl I'm sayin' I do
Love you
You'll be always in my heart
They're not the ones who'll be there for you
When you need someone to turn to
They won't be anywhere be anywhere
When things start falling down
They're only in it to confuse you
So they can turn around and use you
But it can't happen it won't happen girl
As long as I'm around
Oh why oh why oh why oh why oh why
Why do some people have to tell you lies
I know I know I know I know I know
I love you more than words could ever show
I can't I can't I can't I can't explain
Why do some people have to be that way
I can't take much more
I can't ignore
I have to let you know what's in my heart
Hook
Oh why why why why
Why did you have to listen to the lies
Oh girl my sweet girl

If you could give me one good reason
Why I should believe you
Believe in all the things that you tell
I would sure like to believe you
My heart wants to receive you
Just make me know that you are sincere
You know I'd love for you to lead me
And follow through completely
So won't you give me all I ask for
And if you give your very best
To bring me happiness
I'll show you just how much I adore you
'cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters
Matters to me
Oh baby baby baby baby
Baby 'cause you mean so much to me
Now it's gonna take some workin'
But I believe you're worth it
Long as your intentions are good so good
There is just one way to show it
And boy I hope you know it
That no one could love you like I could
Lord knows I want to trust you
And always how I'd love you
I'm not sure if love is enough
And I will not be forsaken
And I hope there's no mistakin'
So tell me that you'll always be true
Hook
There's a feeling in my heart
That I know I can't escape
So please don't let me fall
Don't let it be too late
There's a time when words are good
And they just get in the way
So show me how you feel
Baby I'm for real
Oh baby baby baby baby baby

All was right
We were one
You were my everything
So in love
Now I've learned
That you weren't there
How could I be so blind for you
Well I seen it in your face
That you were on a date
Girl I should've known you started comin' in so late
Someone else had said
That I had been misled
Until the day our kid found you in someone else's bed

I won't be bothered
And I never want to see your face no more
Sayonara
I won't be bothered
And I never want to see your face no more

But still I could forgive
I stayed strong

He came by
And said our family
Was all a lie
Well I couldn't believe my ears
What he was tellin' me
So I went to call the doctor

Well he really rocked my world
You know good and well he did

I had to watch my back no matter where I was at
Everybody's gunnin' for me
Family did not approve it
I broke a lot of rules to do it
Said they seen me change
I stuck to my decisions
On my own and on a mission
You won't forget my name

Next time you come my way
I'll know just what to say

Can we talk for a minute
Girl I want to know your name

To write you a letter
But I wanted
To be more clever
I wanted to get down and sweet talk you
Hey baby
But just like a Roni you were too shy
But you weren't the only one so was I
Girl if
We should come close again
I know what I'll say then

Oh girl
One more chance
With you again
I will not let it go

I was like peace in a groove
On a sunday afternoon
You were there so was i
In the park 4th of july
I was chillin' with my koolaid
When miss chilli came to relay
That you had a thang for me
Finest thang you'd ever seen
I must admit to you
I've heard them lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off lights on
I guess the groove is on so I am
Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby bayooobaby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
I was like deep in a cool
What'nt gone be nobody's fool
Could not care less who was there
Could've been like anywhere
I was chillin' with my koolaid
Did not want to participate
In no silly conversations
Had no time for new relationships
I must admit to you
When I heard the lines you threw
Although it usually turns me off
But this time you have turned me on
Lights off lights on
I guess the groove is on and I am
Hook
Oh why do I feel the way I do
When all I can think about is you
Diggin' diggin' diggin' on you
What was it in a line
That made me fall for you
Do you know
Why I'm diggin' diggin' diggin' diggin' on you
Diggin' diggin' diggin' diggin' on you
HookGirl it's been a long long time comin'
But I I know that it's been worth the wait
It feels like springtime in winter
It feels like Christmas in June
It feels like heaven has opened up it's gates for me and you
And every time I close my eyes
I thank the lord that I've got you
And you've got me too
And every time I think of it
I pinch myself 'cause
I don't believe it's true
That someone like you
Loves me too
Girl I think that you're truly somethin'
And you're you're every bit of a dream come true

And every time I close my eyes
I thank the lord that I've got you
And you've got me too
And every time I think of it
I pinch myself 'cause
I don't believe it's true
That someone like you
Loves me too

I've cried myself to sleep
You really oughtta know
How much you mean to me
It's only right that you be in my life right here with me
Oh baby baby

Early in the morning I put breakfast at your table
And make sure that your coffee has it's sugar and cream
Your eggs are over easy your toast done lightly
All that's missing is your morning kiss that used to greet me
Now you say your juice is sour it used to be so sweet
And I can't help but to wonder if you're talking about me
We don't talk the way we used to talk it's hurting me so deep
I got my pride I will not cry
But it's making me weak
I'm not your superwoman
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down
And think that everythings ok
Boy I am only human
This girl needs more than occasional
Hugs as a token of love from you to me
I fought my way through the rush hour trying to make it home just for you
I want to make sure that your dinner will be waiting for you
But when you get there you just tell me you're not hungry at all
You said you'd rather read the paper and you don't want to talk
You're like to think that I'm just crazy when I say that you've changed
I'm convinced I know the problem you don't love me the same
You're just going through the motions and you're not being fair
I got my pride I will not cry
Still I can't help but care

I need love I need trust your love
HookA summer love is beautiful
But it's not enough
To satisfy emotions
That are shared between us
A winter love is cozy
But I need so much more
It just intensifies my wants
To have a love that endures
Cause every time I close my eyes
I think of you
And no matter what the season nears
I still love you
With all my heart
And I want to be with you
Wherever you are

I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right
An autumn love is special
At this time of the year
But when the leaves are gone
Does that love disappear
I never underestimate the new love of spring
But I'm glad to say in my heart
I know my love's lasting
Cause every time I close my eyes
I think of you
And no matter what the season nears
I still love you
With all my heart
And I want to be with you
Wherever you are

Cause every time I close my eyes
I think of you
And no matter what the season nears
I still love you
With all my heart
And I want to be with you
Wherever you are

You did it right in front of my face
As if I had no pride
And now you're always working late
You never have much time for me
And you're expecting me to believe
That you're not out with she
Tonight I give you my surprise
I hope that you won't mind
I'm giving you an eye for an eye
Baby I've found another
And he is my lover
And I'm going out for the rest of your life

I betcha never thought I'd break your heart
I betcha never even thought at all

But what if they're intentional
The intention of your crimes
Cause I know how much that I can take
I know my heart demands a change

Tonight I give you my surprise
In return for all the lies

Together we'll both make history
'Cause we got a love so strong we're boundless through time
Let's be romantic baby
Let's be the ones who stay in love
Let's make a promise
Let's stay in love
Just to think of us is magic
It's such a sweet melody
Baby afraid that we don't abuse it
For darling a love like this to go so easily
Oh to think of the sadness
So many hearts all day are lost and torn apart
Baby that won't be you and me
Together we'll both make history
'Cause we got a love so strong we'll last through all time

Let's be romantic
Let's stay in love

Keep on giving up my love

This was the place of our first date
It was a place we love
That was the place we laughed
Where we had so much fun
There was the place I met her
That's where we fell in love
And it was the place where she broke my heart
So how do we tell this story
Of someone I love so much
When she lost her feelings for me
Oh how I miss her touch
Have you ever loved someone so much
It hurts like hell
To see the love that she once gave to you
She gives to someone else
Have you ever ever ever loved
To find yourself
To see the love she gave
The love you made
The joys and praise
She saved for someone else
She was a girl called beautiful
And I was so proud of she
How could a girl like here
Be with someone like me
There was I time I had her heart
And oh what a time it was
But I never thought that time
Would take my only true love
So how do we tell this story
Of someone I love so much
She lost her feelings for me
Oh I miss her touch

It's hard to conceive
Or to trust and believe
That you can find true love again
Someone who'll understand
'cause he hurt you and left you
Broke your heart in two
Now I'm here to rescue you
Make all your dreams come true
Baby come to me
Let me be your everything
I'll be the only man you need
If you just believe in me
And baby you'll never wonder why
My love will stand the test of time
And you will never have to look for love again
Looking in your eyes
I begin to fantasize
My very own angel sent for me
Just to set this poor heart free
Now I'm lonely no longer
Feeling so complete
Now I've got to make you realize
That my love will never die
Hook
Girl when you come to me
We'll hear the angels sing
Open your heart to me
We'll have the perfect love
Girl when you come to me
I will now and for always
Supply your needs
From here until eternity

Somethin' you wanna know
Ask me boy
I'll tell you so
Don't you talk to the world
You can talk to me baby
Somethin' you wanna know
Yo left eye
I can't believe he fell for that rumor
All he had to do was come ask you
Sittin' all alone can't think of nothin' better to do
So yo I keeps callin' you
Each discussion's a little bit colder
Seems to me you givin' two of those shoulders
Whatever it is and if it's nothin'
I wish that you would tell me somethin'
Got me thinkin' I'm losin' you
Yo so what am I suppose to do
Somethin' you wanna know
Ask me boy
I'll tell you so
Don't you talk to the world
You can talk to me baby
Somethin' you wanna know
Ask me boy
I'll tell you so
You can talk to your girl
I won't lie to you baby
Scratchin' up the phone goin' crazy
You think it' ain't suppose to phase me
Yellin' at you for even startin' to belive
In any kind of that crap street yap you been receivin'
And what's so unfair
You been doggin' me out about matters unclear
You can't solve a problem it it's trapped inside your mind
It's a conversation blind
Hook
You know you shouldn't fall for everything that they tell you
Unless you get it straight from the horse's mouth 
You know that everything they tell you boy is just hearsay
You gotta be careful when the rumor's out
True enough now you know if I were to pick up
A piece of that he say she say stuff
Think about it
I would doubt it as to callin' a bluff
But unlike you I wouldn't breaka da rules
By jumpin' into concluse
I'd eat a steak and potato while thinkin' it over later
Leave a tip two quarters and a condom for the waiter
What to do
Now's the time I decided to bring it on back to you
So we can talk it through and through
Becasue it ain't nothin' better than talkin' to me
When you wanna know somethin'
Than havin' to get a piece of info from who knows
I'm gettin' fed up 'cause yo 'cause
Words become a quote or somethin' better like a story
It's far from okey doke close to fiction
Half is true but then the other is a conviction
So I'm blamed with an infliction
From which others have created
Then have socially debated
So yo don't you know that the story's been inflated

If it's somethin' you wanna know 
They just ask me baby
Ooh so tenderly 
I'll tell you what you wanna hear 
You can talk to your girl
I won't lie to you baby
Remember don't let anyone come between you

That misery loves company 
And this special shot goes out to all those

Wake up in the morning to our song
It's torture 'cause I left the radio on
Don't wanna turn it off reminiscing about you
I guess I'm gonna leave the damn thing on
'cause it's sitting across the room
I've gotta spend my days working hard
To come home to myself
Trying to get you out of my mind
Thinking of the things we used to do
I try to compensate for you
But nothing seems to work
Baby can I ask you
How did he love ya
Does he want ya
Does he wake up in the night
Just to stare at you asleep
Does he hold ya
Does he flaunt ya
Does he do it do it
Like we did it back at home at home at home
Just thinking about the way
That we made love
Just layin' all day and squeezin' each other tight
I miss those days oh baby would you bring them back
It's not right for me tonight baby
How does it feel
To know you hurt someone so bad now baby
How do you live with yourself
You're probably out there having fun with your other man
Well I don't give a damn baby

Has taken over me
Completely
And boy you are the star
To come into my life
You can take me
Of all the guys I've ever known

So special and so sweet to me
In all the dreams I've ever dreamed
No one has been as good to me
And you're the one to answer my dream
Why do I believe
That I belong to you
How can I explain the symphony
As far as I can tell
My heart's under your spell
And you're the only one
The only one for me
I feel you in my soul
Your heart's caressing me
So deeply
I'm under your control

No one has been as beautiful
So strong and understanding to me

I don't like the way he treats you
He doesn't deserve you
He really don't
What kind of man
Would leave you standing in the cold
Must've been a silly one
To sacrifice a pot of gold
You're the kind of woman
That needs a man that's always there
It's not that you require a lot
Just need some tender love and care
I give good love
I'll buy your clothes
I'll cook your dinner too
Soon as I get home from work
I'll pay your rent
Your faithful lover
Soon as I get home soon as I get home from work

And I'll never lie
For all that it's worth
I give good love 
It doesn't make sense
That you should have a broken heart

So hard to say goodbye
But I just can't keep living this lie
Try to hold back my tears
But my heart still cries
Boy if you you only knew
The hardest part is saying goodbye
I never thought the day would come when
I would have to overcome
The love and joy and happiness that we once shared
But the pain inside my heart is too much for one soul to bear
It's hard enough to live this life without you cause
Hook
Love is when you lose your only
Without you I'm eternally lonely
Cause you were everything
And everything is you
But how could so much pleasure turn to so much pain
I never knew my sun could turn into rain

Singing that sad song
The one about living my life without you

In the rolling night
In the stardust of a pale moon light
I think of you in black and white
When we were made of dreams
I walk alone through the shady streets
Listening to my heart beat
In the recordbreaking heat
And we were born in time
Just when I thought you were gone
You came back
Just when I regretted to receive you
You were smooth you were rough
You were more and enough
Ah babe why did I believe it
I believe it in the rising curve
And the ways of nature will test every nerve
I took you close and got what I deserved
And we were born in time
Just when I knew who to thank
You went blank
Just as the firelight was gleaming
You were snow you were rain
You were striped and you were plain
Oh babe can it be you've been scheming
Well I'd really be in the hills of mystery
In the foggy web of destiny
You're still so deep inside of me
And we were born in time

Original version
In the lonely night
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
You're comin' thru to me in black and white
When we were made of dreams
You're blowing down the shaky street
You're hearing my heart beat
In the record breaking heat
Where we were born in time
Not one more night not one more kiss
Not this time baby no more of this
Takes too much skill takes too much will
It's revealing
You came you saw just like the law
You married young just like your ma
You tried and tried you made me slide
You left me reelin' with this feelin'
On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve
You won't get anything you don't deserve
Where we were born in time
You pressed me once you pressed me twice
You hang the flame you'll pay the price
Oh babe that fire
Is still smokin'
You were snow you were rain
You were striped you were plain
Oh babe truer words
Have not been spoken or broken
In the hills of mystery
In the foggy web of destiny
You can have what's left of me
Where we were born in timeJust gonna chill tonight
With you by my side
And look into your eyes
We gonna mellow out
Lay back on the couch
And maybe just unwind
And we don't care about what others might say
That we don't never ever go anyplace
'Cause we're all that we need
And that's where we want to be
'Cause we're so so so much in love
And that's the way love flows
That's the way it goes
On a saturday night 
That's the way love flows
Everybody knows
Couldn't be more right

Maybe take a ride
By the oceanside
And watch the sun go down
Play the radio
Jam to somethin' slow
Hey tell me how that sounds
And as the night takes over the day
Let's initiate the love that we'll make
And that's just what we'll do
'Cause we're into me and you
Because we're so so so much in love

And as the night takes over the day
Let's initiate the love that we'll make
And that's just what we'll do
'Cause we're into me and you
'Cause we're so so so much so much in loveWritten by babyface 
Performed by aretha franklin
Love was always supposed to be
Something wonderful to me
To watch it grow inside yourself
To feel your heart beside itself
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad

Sometimes it hurts to even laugh

Sometimes the pain is just too much
And it hurts like hell
That's the way it feels
True love it has no hiding place
It's not something you just put away
It's always there inside of you
And it shows in everything you do
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad

Sometimes it hurts to even laugh

Sometimes the pain is just too much
And it hurts like hell
That's the way it feels
Here we are the two of us
So full of love so little trust
But dying for some tenderness
But too afraid to take the step
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad

Sometimes it hurts to even laugh

Sometimes the pain is just too much
And it hurts like hell
That's the way it feels
I know if there is any chance
For us to find out happiness
We've got to learn to let it go
Forget all the pain we know
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh
Sometimes the pain is just too much
And it hurts like hell
That's the way it feelsChestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Helps to make the season bright yeah
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninetytwo
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas Merry Christmas to youSo ya never meant to hurt nobody
Well I think your full of it
'Cause if ya really really didn't want to hurt nobody
You wouldn't slept with my best friend
And I bring insult to my injury
You weren't a bit discrete
And while the world stood witness
To my embarrassment
You put a knife inside of me

How could you fall in love with him
How could you give your heart to him
Thought we'd grow old
As lovers
Together til' the end
How could you fall
Fall in love with him
Now I know we've had our up and downs
And that I do admit
But sometimes lovers go astray
But you've made it permanent
Oh I can't be there understanding
My heart's just not that big 
And I can take the pain
Of infidelity
But I can't take you with him
My love
I'll never find the words my love
To tell you how I feel my love
Mere words could not explain
Precious love
You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again
Only you
Cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me thick and thin
This song is for you
Filled with gratitude and love

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For god blessed me with you
You made me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
Make me feel brand new
My love
Whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me
Precious friend
With you I'll always have a friend
You're someone who I can depend
To walk a path that never ends
Without you
My life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay
You for having faith in me

The sooner you realize
The better you will be
For life holds no promise
For you or for me
Like sand through the hourglass
Our time's all run out
And no one will question
What it's all about
But maybe there's still
One last chance
A chance for you and i
To have true romance
And you should know by now
How much I care for you
And that I would do anything
To prove my love to you
 I'll send you roses
Yeah full of poses
'cause I want your love
Baby I'll send you roses
Yeah full of poses

That I'm the one for you
You're the only one for me
Like sand through the hourglass
Our time will run out
And then my love could be
Alone without a doubt

How many times you're gonna let him use you
You think that you would know by now
How could you let him treat you so bad
How many times will you let him break your heart
I heard he lied to you
I heard your love he abused
Don't say it isn't so
I see it in your eyes
It's something you can't hide
Hook
He gives you lonely nights
And he can hear you cry
And your love he always denies
He's never gonna change
He just can't accept the blame

Girl dry your eyes
Get up off your face
Don't be ashamed
Find someone else new
Someone who'll appreciate you
Always love you

Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with youI was born on the northside of a
Midwestern town
There was nine of us living in a
Three bedroom house
Didn't have much money but we made do
'Cause Momma worked all day long
And daddy did too
Did all they could
Made sure we had clothes and food
Went to public schools and we
Followed public rules
We used second hand books but oh
I didn't mind the books
Momma taught us early in life everybody's gotta
Struggle sometime

Bring back those simple times of yesterday
When a man was a man
And a friend was a friend
Bring back those simple times of yesterday
When you said what you meant
And you menat what you said
Had a friend named Bobby
Who always kept his word
We went through schoolyard fights
Had a thing for pretty girls
Didn't cost much money to
See the picture show
So we hopped the bus into town
That's where all the girlies used to go
Fifty cents would buy us popcorn for two
'Cause Bobby's girl she worked there and
Sometimes she's break the rules
Picnics in the summer
Wouldn't wake up 'till noon
And even though Bobby's gone now
I can still hear him laugh
In the middle of June

Sometimes I sit I wonder
I reminisce I think of all the good times
That we had in our lives
Sometimes I can't get over
How wonderful those days were
Back in our lives

You wanted something else

Verse
I'm sitting here by myself feeling alone
I got a call from my girlfriend
Begging me to leave you alone
She told me she saw you
The other night at a bar
You were wrapped up real tight with someone in the dark
Well it wasn't me
Cause I was here waiting on you
And you're a pathological lair
Never telling the truth what do you want me to do

I don't understand why you do the things you do
And why you had to hurt me so bad as good as I been to you 
I don't understand why you do the things you do
And why you had to hurt me so bad as good as I been to you 
Verse
You told me not to worry and stop having all the doubts
I got a call from another girlfriend
Telling me I ought to put you out 
You're the talk of the town
Running around having fun
Like a fool I'm sitting at home thinking I'm your 1 
Well it's not fair
And how could you not care
As good as I been to you
How could you do the things you do I don't understand no

That kind of friendship never ends no baby
But we were fortunate to care enough
We knew just where we stood
But soon as love appeared
You turned away
And you were so unsure and so afraid
Of feeling what I was feeling
You were scared that love
Would blow your heart away
And you were certain that
In time my love would stray
Where where will you go
And who who's gonna love you like I do
Where where will you go
And who's gonna love like I do
What kind of friends could we have been
If we had kept the feelings in
When we had made a vow to be the friends
We were since we began
But soon as love appeared
You turned away
And you were so unsure and so afraid
Of feeling what I was feeling
You were scared that love
Would blow your heart away
And you were certain that
In time my love
You were thinkin' that our love was gonna stray

Where where will you go
And who who's gonna love you baby

I don't have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby you just see
We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me and never
Say goodbye
When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

Girl I know you really love me
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together forever
You and I
Can you love me again like you loved me before
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down
Girl I'm here for you
All those times of night when you just hurt me
And just ran out with that other fella
Baby I knew about it I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you do you
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat on you all night
Just like you did baby but that's all right
Hey I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'till my dying day baby
Right now I'm just in so much pain baby
Cause you just won't come back to me
Will you just come back to me

Yes baby my heart is lonely

My heart hurts baby

I'm feel pain too
Baby please
This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down
You've gotta be
Outta your mind
You've gotta be
The best thing ever in my life
So why would i be
Taking a chance
Of losing the one most important thing
That I can call mine

And I never could love you enough
Girl the one thing I know I won't do
I won't break your heart
I love you
You much be trippin'
With an illusion
'Cause I don't sleep around
I don't sneak around
Girl stop your trippin'
With your illusions
Gotta stop now
'Cause I don't sneak around
Girl we should be
Having a time
We shouldn't be
Fighting each and every night
I don't understand
How you could feel
I've been untrue and so unfaithful
Girl you're making me ill
When you know that I've been there for you
Anything that you asked I would do
In my heart of all hearts I've been true
And I don't deserve this
Not from you

Girl I think that I understand
But I'm not every other man
How can you blame me on what other have done
Can't you see this predicament
Doesn't make one bit of sense
Come back to earth
And you might come back to love

But I've done for you all that I can
If I ever see you in the street
Just forget that you ever knew me
Cause I still hear the words in my head
Those are some words I will never forget
HookIn the twinkling of an eye
Girl you had me hypnotized
And I didn't care a thing about love
But I quickly start believin'
'Cause I found myself a reason in you
Yea I got a thang for you
And when I think
Think of the way I used to be
I was always all alone
Always doing something wrong
And when I think
Think of the change you brought to me
Girl I wonder why it took you so long

Well alright
Well OK baby
I finally done me something right
I got you in my life
Well alright
Well OK baby
I finally done me something right
I got you in my life
It was deep within my heart
Where the feelin' had to start
I had reason to believe it was love
And I'm sure that's what it was
'Cause I've never felt so much in me
Yea you brought love into me
And when I think
Think of they way things used to be
I was always much too cold
I was always all alone
And when I think baby
Think of the love you brought to me
I don't know how I could've ever got along

In this wake of happiness
I can't help but feel blessed
From you baby
'Cause of you girl
For the first time in my life
I know I've done it right
I fell in love with you

My heart has been broken cause of you
One always must leave that's nothing new
I thought that you'd really like to try to stay
Stay together let's try again
It's been 17 months on my own
The nights are so quiet all alone
I long to feel you in my arms again
Girl won't you please come back home
Spendin' my nights all alone
Really really wish you'd come home
Savin' my heartbreak for you
Makes me blue sadder than blue
Days walk past me like years
I struggle to swallow my tears
It's been a long time since I held you near
I still remember the scent of you dear
29 hours in my day
Feel like hell every day
Hopin' I get through to you
'cause I sure miss you
Come back come back to me
Hook
I never wanted to swallow my pride
I tried to play it cool so cool
Girl if we only could go back in time
I wouldn't hold back a damn thing from you
Hook
If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear I love you now and then
Will I never make love to you once again
Please understand if love ends
Then I promise you I promise you
That that I shall never breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
That I shall never breathe again
Breathe again
And I can't stop thinkin' about
About the way things used to be
And I can't stop thinkin' about
About the love that you make to me
And I can't get you outta my head
How in the world will I begin
To let you walk right out my life
And blow my heart away
And I can't stop carin' about
About the apple of my eye
And I can't stop doin' without
Without the center of my life
And I can't get you outta my head
And I know I can't pretend
That I won't die if you decide
You won't see me again

And I can't stop thinkin' about
About the way my life would be
No I can't stop thinkin' about
How could your love be leavin' me
And I can't get you outta my mind
God knows how hard I tried
And if you walk right out my life
God knows I'd surely die
And I can't stop doin' without
Without the rhythm of my heart
No I can't stop doin' without
For I would surely fall apart
And I can't get you outta my mind
'Cause I know I can't deny it
And I would die if you decide
You won't see me again

A thousand words for why I love you
Girl I could go on all night telling you why it'll be true
Let's stretch out on my leather couch under our 18 by 22
I cannot try to explain it
Baby how can say it to you
Girl you're the rest of my life and all
And you come whenever I call
Girl I just wanna say it
I thank you from the bottom of my heart
That's why
Baby what you are to me
No one else can be
Ooh and I think I'm in love baby
Ooh ooh baby just can't stop this feelin'
From taking over and over
And I know I can't stop it girl you're mine
You're mine yeah
I can understand how you want your space
Give it all some time to let it soak into your mind
Searching all my life for a woman like you
Gonna do exactly what my precious heart tells me to
Oh girl you're the rest of my life and all
And you come whenever I call girl
And baby I just wanna say it
I thank you from the bottom of my heart
Ooh ooh baby what you are to me
No one else can be
Ooh and I think I'm in love baby
Ooh ooh baby just can't stop this feelin'
From taking over and over
And I know I can't stop it girl you're mine
I know that you've been hurt before
By men who swear it all
But I just wanna say
Wanna take it day by day
I'm gonna pick you up whenever you
Pick you up whenever you fall
Hook 3 timesWhat must I say to you
To get inside your head
Why must you always think
I want to get in your pants
And why I always gotta be
The closest thing to wrong
Sometimes the only thing a brother need
He need a woman to be strong
Well I ain't cryin' I ain't cryin'
Done 'bout run out of tears
But you're the closest thing to heaven
I need you to be near
Hear me darlin' hear me darlin'
I can't make it more clear
The only thing that's gonna get me through
Is if I got you right here

Ooo girl talk to me
You're the only one that comforts me
My only reality is I want you for my woman
Ooo girl speak to me
Let me hear you sayin' that you're
stayin' with me
I know my reality is without you
I ain't nothin' at all
Why does everything I say to you have
to be suspect
Feel like the only way I'll get with you
Somethin' blows off my head
Well I ain't tryin' to go out like that
I want to keep myself clean
Sometime the only thing a brother need
He need the strength from his queen
I ain't lyin' I ain't lyin' done 'bout
run out of time
The only time I want to do right now
Is feel you by my side
Hear me darlin' hear me darlin'
I can't be more sincere
The only thing that's gonna get me through
Is if I got you right here

Well I said everything's gonna be all right
When you stand by my side
Gonna work things out tonight
We're gonna make out just fine
For once I'd like for you to be
The one who has the faith in me
And I promise I won't
let you down this time

Melt yourself into my body

Maybe we could stop our make believe

Back in the day
When I was younger
I wasn't afraid
Of giving my heart to you
Now and again
I get sentimental
But I know it's just a phase I'm going through
And every time I start to slip
I just remind myself
I need only think of it
I went through so much hell
You say you wanna get things back
The way they used to be
Can you give me one good reason
Why should I darlin'
Why should I care
Why should I care for you

I should have been wiser
But what can I say
I should have been onto you
But I was afaid
That you'd break my heart in two
Fate would have it that you broke it anyway baby

I just remind myself
You told about a million lies
You put my heart through hell
And now you wanna get with me
Just for old times sake

Since you been gone
I been hangin' around here lately
With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car tried to clear my mind
Didn't help me
I guess I'm all messed up now baby
Soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play
A song comes on the radio
And there u are baby once again
It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you
Since you been gone
I keep thinkin' about you baby
Gets me all choked up
This heart of mine keeps
Dreamin' of you and it's crazy
You'd think I'd had enough
As soon as I get you out my head
I'm in your car again
Just one request from the radio
I'm back in love sugar once again

Then somebody sings
Only takes a beat
And then it starts killin' me darlin'
Only takes one note I tell ya
From that radio

Last night you were so into it
You told me secrets that
You never told a soul
You were so nervous and
Yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine as you taste mine
I kissed your lips you felt my body slip
Into your soul
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
Last night I was inside of you
Last night while making love to you
I saw the sun the moon the mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you
Last night there was no believing it
It was so special
And so very innocent
We talked of memories
Our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
Deep in the night
Right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight in your soul
You felt incredible
I started to explode
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

We were put here together that's the way love's designed

This uncredible feeling could be passing us by
What's the point in giving up when when we're doing fine
We don't need to be lonely when our love is so right
I wanna be true

Two lovers lovers for life 
True lovers who cherish each other lovers forever true lovers

I know how to excite you make it last thru the night

But we must be sincere
I know we've been
Been here so many times before
But don't you think
Think that our love's worth fighting for
If we try
Just one time oh baby
If we try
Then I'll know we'll get by
Our love is gentle
It's give and take
It's all about the vows we make
Whether we honor them
With love and trust
It's all up to us
Who needs another sad affair
Girl if we care
We'll end it right here
We could be lovers
If we'd only share
All that we feel
But we must be sincere
I know we've been
Been here so many times before
But don't you think
Think that our love's worth fighting for
If we try
Just one time oh baby
If we try
Then I'll know we'll get by

I bet I know your day
Bet you left for work 'bout ten minutes late
You didn't even wear the dress I bought
Didn't eat at our favorite spot baby
You found a new place uum
So I'm sittin' here at the same time
Pickin' up the pieces you left behind
Oh now God know that I miss your face
Can't help but wonder what it takes baby
To get back in your life girl
How often do you think of me
How often do I enter your mind girl
Is there ever a time
How often do you cry for me
I cry for you like all the time
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
Your mind your mind
Girl what we had was so strong
That's why it lasted so long yeah
You couldn't find yourself a better man
That's why I just don't understand dear
Why you're not here girl
Hook
I've got to get back to you
The reasons are so clear
I know that I can't live without you
Now that you're not here

I need to know you still love me

Performed by dru hill
God knows that you're a sexy thang
It's taking everything in me
Not to kiss you over under
Feel you inside feel my thunder
How the hell could I not want you
Girl it don't have to be a thang
I'll wait for you you wait for me
'cause true love is insisting we don't have to rush at all
These are the times we all wish for
The moment we less means so much more
We don't have to do a thing at all
We can take our time and talk
And this is the way things need to be
No pressure from you and none from me
Just let the mood set the moment off
We can make love or not at all
Be thinkin' 'bout you all the time
Morning noon and suppertime
Tear you up in little pieces
Swallow you like reese's pieces
Come on girl you know I need you
 it ain't s'posed to be a thing
 I'll wait for you you wait for me
 true love's insisting we don't have to rush at at all
Hook
I don't make promises
'cause I know my heart gets weak
I get around you girl
It makes them hard to keep
'cause you bring out the best you make me the man
God knows I'm proud to be

I fell in love with the girl in the picture
That I used to keep
Carried her 'round in the back of my pocket
She was always with me
I imagine that I was a man of importance
And she had a fancy for me
And I use to dream she would call
Crying her eyes out
She had an obsession with me
I was the love of her life
And she was all mine
The girl in the life magazine
The first time I we met in an aisle
At the market
She was staring at me
I knew even then we would share
Something special
And it was like chemistry
I fell in love from the moment I saw her
So I took her straight home with me
And that's where I'd dream
She would step right out of the picture
And spend a whole evening with me
And oh how she hated to go
Back to her picture
The girl in the life magazine
All of my friends used to laugh
Said I was certifiably mad
'til the day she came
And she blew them away
And asked me if I'd be her man
It seems that she went and fell
In love with my letters
Says she's been looking for me
So the story ends well
We end up together
The girl in the life magazine

La chica de la revista

Fue de la chica de aquella revista que me enamore
En mi bolsillo su foto escondida
Para siempre guarde
Y yo me sentia un hombre importante
Al verla mirandome a mi
En suenos a veces la vi
Obsesionada
Llamando y llorando por mi
Yo era su vida su amor
Y ella queria
Delar la revista por mi
La vi una tarde alla en el mercado
Me miraba al pasar
Y adivine que algo estaba empezando
Una aventura especial
Me enamore en ese mismo momento
Vino conmigo a vivir
Y en casa sone
Que salio de aquella revista
A darme una noche feliz
No se queria marchar
Solo queria
Coro
Y se reian de mi 
Como si fuese un loco total
Hasta el dia en que a todos se lo demostro
Ella me vino a buscar
Y fue asi que al leer todas mis cartas
Se fue enamorando de mi
Y al final ya lo ve
Por fin la muchacha

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assured
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older everyday
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day
As today I know I'm living for tomorrow
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I've felt behind
Cause I'll be loving you always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last forever and another day
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
For now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
And I'll be loving you always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
HookLast night I laid with you
'Twas like a dream come true
I've never felt so right

How much I love you girl

That you would forever be cool

And I gotta tell ya baby

When could I stay away from the arousal of love
And my soul would not be inferfered by my eyes and ears easily
I adjust my gesture of my softest tenderness
My heart is so cautious I won't react hastily
Love
It's not as beautiful as anticipated
The woman in remorse
Sad love songs can be heard in every street
On this horizon is there a man suitable for me
Who can appropriately comfort my indescribable loneliness
How many years have I been drifting in the sea of love
How many times did I cry and go wild when I was young
Whenever I fall in love
There is always a force driving you involuntarily
The faces of my previous lovers are unclear
When everything is over my heart still feels the pain
Next time when I meet the right person
How can I turn back
How should I handle
From now on
I am not eager to breakthrough from the freedom of loneliness
As long as love doesn't sneak it's way in and bother me
Beautitful lies and genuine love are only separated by a thin line
If you are not careful everything will be mixed up and
It'll be hard to take back your hear
Love
It's not as beautiful as anticipated
The woman in remorse
Sad love songs can be heard in every street
On this horizon is there a man suitable for me
Who can appropriately comfort my indescribable loneliness
Hook
You'll only ask for one outcome when you're in love
How come whenever we meet it will turn out to be
A complex of love and hatred
What would be considered a promise of mutual benefit
Let give and take can be clearly shown until the last moment
Hook 2 times'Twas late December the news came
And I got excited I cried all day
And you were such a lovely precious sight
When I saw our baby in your eyes

It was like falling deep in love
I heard the angels cry above
I felt a blessing straight from God
The day that you gave me a son
I called 'bout everyone I knew
Just think I'll be a father 'cause of you
There's no greater love than what you gave
A brand new baby on the way

Oh such tears of joy I've never known
I can't remember
It's like a song I've never heard
I've never sung but know the wordsBaby baby
Don't 'cha think
You would like to
Spend the night with me
Darlin' darlin'
Can't you see
That you and I were
Always meant to be
Baby if you believe in magic
Baby I'll reach for the stars
And I'll bring the dream to you
Whatever you wish for you can have it
It'll come straight from the heart
Baby 'cause I I want you
To want me like I do want you
I can't stop my heart I'm in love
You're the only one that I want
I want it I need it
I want to be the one and only one you love
I want it I need it
I want to be the one and only one you love
Girly girly
It's plain to see
Ain't no other
Place I'd rather be
Girly baby
Live with me
I'll make you happy
And that I guarantee
Baby 'cause I believe in magic
Baby I wished upon a star
And I found a dream called you
Baby 'cause you can make love happen
Let it fall straight from your heart
Baby 'cause I I want you
To want me like I do want you

Baby 'cause I I want you
To want me like I do want you

I want it baby I need it
I want to be the only one the only only only only one

If there's a time when the tears should fill your eyes
And you can't see past the shadows
To the sun on the other side
Don't despair because there always will be someone there
Don't lose faith
Love won't let you lose your way because you
You'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong when you can't find the strength inside and you
You'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
You'll never stand alone
Love is standing by
Oh yes it is yes
If there's a day when the rain should find your heart
And your cold inside and lonely
And this world has you in the dark
Don't be scared you can just reach for me and I'll be there
Don't lose hope
Love will see you through you know because you

Thank you baby
For the years you've given me
For each beat of my heart
For every breath I breathe
Thank you sweetie
For the best times of my life
Through the good through the bad
You were always by my side
I never thought I'd meet someone
Who loves unselfishly
But I appreciate the way you loved and sacrificed for me
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry 
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die 
Thank you lady
For the joy you bring to life
When I thought all was lost and gone
You brought hope back in sight
Thank you honey
For being my best friend
When I thought no one understood
You would always understand
I used to think that I knew love
And what true love should mean
Now I know that I did not know much
'cause you taught me everything
Hook
God so loved the world
That he blessed us all with you
And then he gave me a heart

My happiness I do rejoice
In the love you give unselfishly
Your constant sacrifice for me

They say falling in love's a mistake
it could be just about anybody

First chapter
You stole my heart away from me
Made me believe true love could be
We were so close you changed my life
How could a love so strong not go right
Where do we go from here
When it's said our love would stay around
Why do I even care
The way you looked it can't be found
My heart is broken down
I'm turning pages once again
It's time to make this story end
Time to close the book to this story
I don't want to read it no more
Time to close the book to this story
Another writer will come along I'm sure
Final chapter
I say goodbye I made you cry
I did what I could you know I tried
There's no more to say so I'll go my way
You know that it hurts me
But that's the price we pay
Where do we go from here
When it's said our love would stay around
Why do I even care
When I looked it can't be found
My heart is broken down
I'm turning pages once again
It's time to make this story end

When autumn first arrived you were my lady
And love was written in the winter snow
Then with the change of months there came october
And now I wonder where that love did go
It was the second rain of autumn we shared a feeling
It was such such a glorious autumn dream yes it was
But like kids we were too shy to say to each other 
That together we would always like to be
Someday soon I know we'll come together
Even though our feelings change as seasons do
But maybe sweet november will tell us the story
That will bring us back the love that we both knew
When autumn first arrived you said you'd be my lady
And promised me that you would never go
Then with the change of months then came october
And now I'm wondering where where did our love go

Spending all my time watching that girl go

Gotta love her when she moves

Hold up let you make love to me baby
Hold up let me take my pants off baby
Hold up let you be real to me baby
Messing around again
Acting like way back when
We were just beside ourselves
With love touching your lovely skin
Remembering feelings within
To rush the moment could be so hasty
When you taste me
Hook
Exploring the most within
If we're in love then is it sin
Pushing my thoughts into your dreams
You know what it means
Pouring your body melts
And in the morning tell me how it felt
Hope it's just as good for you
As you are to me
Hook

I wake up while you lie sleepin'
I take one look at you and wonder
Am I still sleepin'
Are you some kind of angel
Come down to save me
Or just some place my imagination's tryin' to take me
What have I done to deserve what I feel
You give me somethin' that's too good to be real
How does a treasure like you fall into my hands
I need to know just one thing
I still don't understand
Why do you love me
Why do you give so much
How do you heal the pain within me
Is it the power of your touch
Now that you've opened up the heavens
For this heart of mine to see
I've become the richest man that I could ever be
Baby why baby why me
Why me why me
I ain't got a clue just a notion
Sometimes I'm helplessly adrift out in the ocean
I feel like a child with one sole intention
In search of an answer that defies all comprehension
I'm in too deep but that's what you're all about
Got no hope or desire of finding my way out
How does a treasure like you fall into my hands
I need to know that one thing
Can ya help me understand

What up yo word to the badd
I gave my love
You gave your love
Thought we'd never part
Said you loved me
Then you left me
With a broken heart
You never think about who you love
You only think about number one
You forgot about where we started from
You only think about what you want
You don't care about how it's done
You only think about you your throne
Be it right or be it wrong
It ain't about your world
It ain't about the things that you do
If you don't care I don't care
'cause you keep thinkin' about you
It ain't about you takin' my pie
You been takin' for a long time
If you don't care I don't care
If you keep
Well I ain't thinkin' about you
Word up yo word to the badd
Once you were made
You changed your ways
Even told me lies
Could not trust you
Still I loved you
My mind worried overtime
You know I tried to be there for you
Like a lover I cared for you
It didn't matter you always play me off
You only care about what you want
You don't care about how it's done
You only think about you your throne
Be it right or be it wrong
Hook
Oh no no I ain't thinkin' about you
Oh no
What up yo word to the badd
Thinkin' about that pie that you've been takin' from me
From a lover to another lover hard to believe
Lost and don't know it yet you still show it
Givin' seems to be harder than it is to receive
The glass has gotten shady when it should have been clearer
But it's you always starin' in the mirror
Constantly fakin' it ain't no mistakin' it
Get a grip 'cause you're not far from breakin' it
Thinkin' about the time when we used to be close
It shouldn't be a past tense 'cause nobody knows
What the future may hold what tomorrow might bring
It's not guaranteed that you'll be spreadin' your wings
And funny it seems how it used to be
Times when you needed to lean on me
Now you're standin' on two and you wanna act now
Girl I ain't thinkin' about you
Gone too far
Ya better turn back
I know who you are
You know where I'm at
Sad but it's true
From me to you
Pick up the phone
Don't be alone
Step off the throne
Come back home

So maybe things did not work out this time

Lord knows that I've been misunderstood
Won't give you up and baby I'll tell you why

I ain't never been out
And I ain't never hit rock bottom
Till the day you put me out
And I know I've done some wrong
But I ain't never hit rock bottom
So baby don't count me out
I was thinkin' in the mornin' it'd be over when I wake up
But then reality had hit me and I jumped up
I had to get myself a dial tone
I started callin' everybody tryin' to get back home
But everybody that I called was being difficult
I took it personal and took it as an insult
For all the time we had been goin' out
Girl I don't understand why you would have to go that route
Well I know that I love you baby
And I know that I'm goin' crazy
Don't think for one minute

Yesterday was not just another day
Not like before
Yesterday I saw your smiling face
Love walked through my door
One precious moment changed my life
One tender kiss made everything alright
One touch from you and this world was mine
It was in your arms where I found forever
Cried my first tears of joy last night
Heaven shined a light
All my dreams came true
My first night with you
Felt the sun shine so bright on me
Chased the rain from my heart
Through a storm through the darkest night
I found my brightest star
One magic moment made one magic night
I fell in love with one look in your eyes
I never knew I could feel so alive
Darling in your arms I could feel forever

Say you can't go a day without me
Hook 2 timesYou're so in love
And that's nice
Just have fun
Living your life
He likes to kiss you
And that's cool
And that's the kind of thing that
Puppy lovers should do
But all your friends are saying
It's a matter of time
Before your Prince Charming
Hits you with the famous line
And all your friends are wondering
Just what you're gonna do
They say that if you do it
They'll have to trust you
But you don't want to do
The things they tell you to
It's not your personality
It's not the way you want to be
And if he treasures you
Then he won't pressure you
Their faith is more than one thing
Left to decide
Take your time 
It's alright
You love your body
You want to do right
Take your time
It's your life
Don't let nobody
Tell you that you're not right
Take your time 
It's alright
You love your body
You want to do right
Take your time
It's your life
Don't let nobody
Tell you that you're not right
Your first time love
Hey that's cool
It's wonderful when love is innocent too
Like holding hands
And walking through the park
It's a special kind of love
What puppy lovers are
But all your friends are saying
That you're running out of time
They say that if you cherish him
You'll change your frame of mind
And all your friends are telling you
That if you're love is true
They say that you should do it
He'll forever cherish you
But you don't want to do
The things they tell you to
It's not your personality
It's not the way you want to be
And if he treasures you
Then he won't pressure you
Their faith is more than one thing
Left to decide
But you don't want to do
The things they tell you to
It's not your personality
It's not the way you want to be

Baby baby love's a mystery
So hard to define
Darling darling more than I can see
Love is so blind
So many times he left you all night long
Don't make no sense for you to carry on
Just give me a chance to know ya
I just want a chance to know ya
All my love I'll give to you
And girl when we're through
I'll be there
Call my name if you should want me
I'll come a running to you baby
I'll be around always around for you
Long as you want me to
Darling darling you can look for me
And I can be found
Sugar sugar you can lean on me
You know that I'm down
All you've had too much to carry on your own
But from now on you'd never walk alone
I'll shelter you in my arms
Cover you with my charms
All my love I give to you
And girl when we're through
I'll be there

Honey I never felt like
I had someone to rely on
Until that day you came
And you made my life complete
And you should know I love you so
Honey you never felt like
You had someone you could count on
Until that day we met
And you put your trust in me
And let me know that you won't let go
Let no man separate us
Let no one come between our love
Let no man separate us
We're sharing our love forever
Darling it doesn't seem like
We've been together for so long
Ain't it funny how time flies
When we're having fun
Well girl the fun has just begun
Just a little bit of wine by candlelight
To celebrate our love ooh baby
Let's be thankful
That we've kept our love so strong
Let's make a vow to carry on

There is no doubt
He left you with  without a clue
I know you think 
You have no future  no future at all
I'll show you how 
How I'll make you not hurt at all
So if we try 
We'll walk through the moonlight
I'm here when you fall
Dry your eyes he left you crying
Deep down inside I know you just feel like dying
Dry your eyes I'm gonna be there for you
Waiting forever
Ever more
Now that he's gone 
Can you find the strength to carry on
I'll show you love
Love and compassion  you'll open your heart

Gave you the best
Best years of my life and i
Gave you a woman
Who stood by your side
Through all your ups and downs
Your rights and all your wrongs
And God knows there were wrongs
I should've been long gone but when i
Made you that promise
For better or worse I said i'd
Stand by your side
I swallowed my pride
And now you're asking me to understand
And I'm telling you I can't
Why should icare about your feelings
When you don't give a damn about mine
And I don't want to know
I couldn't care less about your feelings
Don't you know
You should've cared about mine
And I don't want to know
It really doesn't matter why you're leavin'
You should know
You're really throwin' away your life
And I won't sympathize
You've hurt me for the last time
Got no more tears to cry
Gave you three hearts
One boy and one girl and a
Woman who loves you
We're sittin' here falling apart
All through your ins and outs
Your fears and all your doubts
And God knows there's been doubts
But we've given you a home and you're just
Throwing it away
All far for some girl born yesterday
And what about your children
There is nothing to explain
But still you're asking me to understand
Well I'm telling you we can't
Why should I care about your reasons
When you're walking right out of your lives
Hook
Say goodbye
To all the love and memories
One last time one good look at all the love
That won't be in your life
Say goodbye
I hope that you'll be happy
Don't look back ''cause it'll be too late
I've gone with my life

All alone sad and brokenhearted
Didn't have no peace within
Thought that I would feel this way forever
Oh but darlin' you brought the heaven back again
Sun didn't shine it just kept on raining
So I thought my life was over
But you brought the rainbow at the end of the storm
And if I had to do it all over again
I'd start my life with you oh baby
You got the love I want 
And I know that you got the love I want 
You got the love I want 
Long as I live my life
I want to live my life for you
I must confess girl I love you baby
Although at times I try not to show it
But you got that way of always makin' me say
Here I go I'm givin' in again
Sometimes I just sit down and watch you baby
What did I ever do to deserve you
You don't ever have to worry 'bout
What another girl may say or do
'cause I've searched and I've searched girl my whole life through
And none of them compare to you no baby
Hook
I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you baby
You occupy each moment of the day

You got the love I want 
You got the love I want

We started out as friends
Who really loved being together
Never knowing we would find a love to last forever
For after all
We were just kids experiencing the joys of puppy love
Yet ever since the day we first touched there was a feeling
And even when I think of you right now
I still get a chill up and down my spine
I can't believe the way I feel
After all this time
I love you 
With all my heart and soul
Oh darlin'
I'll never let you go
It's been like twenty years of love and not one minute longer
And tough we have had our ups and downs
Our love keeps getting stronger
What's in our hearts that makes us love the way you do
God keeps blessing me with you
For no one ever dreamed that such a love could get much better
We knew deep in our hearts that destiny would keep us together
We will never apart I can't deny what we feel inside
We'll last thru all time

To my prayers or my dreams
It's just I feel my love needs more consistancy
I'm about out of luck half out of time
I'm just about to lose my mind
I'm starting to lose touch with my reality
I never wished on stars
I never thought that dreams came true
Yet in the midst of all my disbelief
Darlin' now I feel like I am long overdue
I search high and low to find my pot of gold
And that's why 
Some day I'm gonna follow my rainbow
Some day I'm gonna reach for the sky
By then if you're not ready or able
I'll pack my pride for one last time
Cross my heart and pray our love won't die
I'm not looking for an angel
To make good on all my dreams
It's just I feel our love's not all that it should be
I'm not looking for a miracle
A mircale won't do
The only miracle I need is to be you

I fell in love about every summer
And I would be calling up the radio
To dedicate my favorite song to her
And I sung along with everything
The words in the song they spoke to me
Now I need to know where did the music go
Cause my heart is crying out
I need a love song about now
Don't need no ring tone songs now
Please tell the DJ slow it down
I wanna think about my baby now
I want a old school type of slow jam
You know the kinda where they used to romance
When Luther used to sing like 'baby'
And Michael made the world go crazy
I need a 12play two step kelly kinda record 
I need a love song right now

Back in the day when I got older
The music in me had taken over
So I wrote the songs that made the lovers dance
Like I'll Make Love and Breathe Again
Now I want to know where love has been
Its just not the same as it was back then
And the world needs to fall in love again
Cause my heart is crying out
I need a love song about now
Don't need no ring tone songs now
Please tell the DJ slow it down
I wanna think about my baby now
I want a old school type of slow jam
You know the kinda where they used to romance
When Luther used to sing like 'baby'
And Michael made the world go crazy

And everybody used to electricslide
We'd be partying the whole night
And we took it homeoh baby

Cause my heart is crying out
I need a love song about now
Don't need no ring tone songs now

Help me lose my mind make me wonder
What I felt before
Keep biding my time
How much longer
Who've I been waiting for
Jealousy will be washed over

Could it be easy to start over
Somehow I will bring you too

There are voices in my head
And my heart is heart is trying hard to drown them out
I keep hearing what they say
They can space me into what they're all about
Well power slips away
And I'm weakening with every word they say
So I contemplate my faith
As I do the whisper turns into a shout
You bring out the voices inside of me
Can't stop from a place that I can't reach
I would love to practice what I preach
You bring out the voices inside of me
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me
Risking everything I had
I was keen to find the worst that I could do
Throw this sanity away
Brought destruction to the people that I know
My hurt became a cage
I became a puppet on the stage
And even though we're not okay
The feeling brings me blush all the same all the same
You bring out the voices inside of me
Can't stop from a place that I can't reach
I would love to practice what I preach
You bring out the voices inside of me
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught meI can help you run away for good
All for take what you had understood
All it takes is a little understanding
After all don't question if I would
Confess to me make me feel it
Confide in me don't resent it
'Cause I can't stop you from the fire
I'll fulfill your desires for you
Confess to me make me feel it
Confide in me don't resent it
'Cause I can't stop you from the fire
I'll fulfill your desires for you
I'll fulfill your desires for you
I'll fulfill your desires for you
I can take the low out of lonely
I can stop the sense of slowing down
Don't get lost in if you only tell me
I will help you slip and turn it round
Only not to worry
No time left for me
Only not to worry
No time left for me
Only not to worry

I just feel I let you go
Been cheated I've been fooled
But you're my heart and glow gone
Gotta let this fire keep burning
'Cause I can't seem to let this show
Instead of running I keep it slow

Got to get it got got to get it

Defeated no more
I feel your shadow disappear
I've faded and I fought

You had broken puzzle pieces in your hand
With the other you clutched at the falling sand
Running through like the time that you demand
Now you wanna stand up act like the big man
Bridge
So stand your ground now
Come take my hand now
Look what i found now
Perfection in you

Chorus
Oh beg my pardon
Excuse me what i've done
Uhoh i'm above you this time
Oh beg my pardon
Cus' you have been outrun
So find a pen to draw the line
Draw the line
Verse 2
You run faster than i thought you ever could
You want me to turn out just like you said i should
You take away more than i thought you ever would
And you still say that i should just give up
Bridge
So stand your ground now
Come take my hand now
Look what i found now
Perfection in you

Chorus
Oh beg my pardon
Excuse me what i've done
Uhoh i'm above you this time
Oh beg my pardon
Cus' you have been outrun
So find a pen to draw the line
Draw the line

Chorus x 2
Oh beg my pardon
Excuse me what i've done
Uhoh i'm above you this time
Oh beg my pardon
Cus' you have been outrun
So find a pen to draw the line
Draw the line

Pretty open eyes
They fill me up surprisingly
With a hope i'll find
A place to sleep so soundly
Dreams are disguised
As a meaning we should follow
How hard we try
To hold onto ourselves
And not to let go
Chorus
We could call this life
We could call this everything we know
We could say we tried
We could let them say
I told you so
But we'll take this life
And we'll make it everything we know
Then we'll know we tried
Never let them say
I told you
Verse 2
Pretty open eyes
Open up to find just what they seek
When closed they dream
Of places way too far to reach
So find the truth
And you can set yourself free
And we can prove
The all we needed was to believe
Chorus
We could call this life
We could call this everything we know
We could say we tried
We could let them say
I told you so
But we'll take this life
And we'll make it everything we know
Then we'll know we tried
Never let them say
I told you
Middle 8
I told you so seems to come around
More often than i'd like to hear it
Don't wanna hear it I don't wanna hear it
So shut your mouth
Don't make a sound
Erase the doubt that i am bound
That i am stopped by limits
Shut your mouth
Don't make sound
Erase the doubt that i am bound
That i am stopped by limits
Chorus
We could call this life
We could call this everything we know
We could say we tried
We could let them say
I told you so
But we'll take this life

And we'll make it everything we know
Then we'll know we tried

Never let them say
I told you soVerse 1
Oh if you mean it just like you meant it
Then please believe it and don't try to mend it
Cus' cus' when the call comes you'll be falling over your time
And you'll try to run but you'll find that your hands are tied
Chorus
Just look around every corner
And we'll agree to stand in order
And when she comes with her sticks and her stones
We promise that we'll just ignore her
Just look right through every window
And take a last look and hope that you'll know
And when they come with their sticks and theirs stones
We promise that we'll let it all go
Verse 2
The ones you love so let down gaurds and then they show
The flaws they tried to hide so you're the only one who knows
Find then erase me break all ties then maybe you'll be
So lost you'll need to believe
That it's freedom that you need
Chorus
Just look around every corner
And we'll agree to stand in order
And when she comes with her sticks and her stones
We promise that we'll just ignore her
Just look right through every window
And take a last look and hope that you'll know
And when they come with their sticks and theirs stones
We promise that we'll let it all go
We'll it all go
Let it all go
Middle 8
What can you do with the words that are true
If you don't wanna hear it
But it's been left to you
Chorus
Just look around every corner
And we'll agree to stand in order
And when she comes with her sticks and her stones
We promise that we'll just ignore her
Just look right through every window
And take a last look and hope that you'll know
And when they come with their sticks and theirs stones
We promise that we'll let it all go
We'll it all go
Let it all go
We'll let it go
Just a pause and
Nothing more
Just a second
To count the moments we've been waiting for

Will you go quietly
Or put up a fight
Will you inspire me
Or deny

We're running from the unknown
What do we know
We don't know
Where are we going
All we know is that yesterday
We were alive full of life
And now we're going going down

Just light that we'll
We'll ignite
So small and slight
It is what we've all been waiting for

Will you go quietly
Or put up a fight
Will you inspire me
Or deny

We're running from the unknown
What do we know
We don't know
Where are we going
All we know is that yesterday
We were alive full of life
And now we're going going down
We're going down

Will you go quietly
Or put up a fight
Will you inspire me
Or deny

We're running from the unknown

What do we know

We don't know
Where are we going

All we know is that yesterday

We were alive full of life
And now we're going going down
We're going down
We're going down
We're going downVerse 1
Whoa
I'm telling you now
You should try to talk before you shout
We had it all before we found
That the only thing anyone wanted was more
Verse 2
We exceeded everyone
We would have pleaded to have won
We can look back on what we've done
And say that we know that we've gone and done it all
Chorus
Never answer again
Not to anyone

This road is all you'll have
All you'll ever know

I hope you realise i wont let this go

And now you're off the rails
Your stupid ship has sailed

I'm letting go

Verse 3
We had it all
But you can't buy us with a win full
If you don't give us what we want
Then we'll push it right back
Cus' we're in for the long run

Chorus
Never answer again
Not to anyone

This road is all you'll have
All you'll ever know

I hope you realise i wont let this go

And now you're off the rails
Your stupid ship has sailed

I'm letting go
Whoa whoa we had it all
Whoa whoa we had it all
Chorus
Never answer again
Not to anyone

This road is all you'll have
All you'll ever know

I hope you realise i wont let this go

And now you're off the rails
Your stupid ship has sailed

I'm letting goVerse 1
Thank god cus' i dont need this
I was smiling as i walked in
You wiped the smile right off my face
Give me a second before i begin
Verse 2
Thank god cus' i just needed
A weight to be lifted off my shoulders
Since today i have been feeling
Like i was backed down into a corners
Bridge
I'll sing you a sad song
So you can drown your sorrows
Chorus
Just wait you'll be
A million miles away from me
When i say that i am
Feeling a whole lot better
Just wait you'll see
That with your childish little frown
You were only bringing me down
Verse 3
Hey you i heard you needed
Something to make you smile wider
Have you heard that i have seen it
A future that is so much brighter
Bridge
I'll sing you a sad song
So you can drown your sorrows
Chorus
Just wait you'll be
A million miles away from me
When i say that i am
Feeling a whole lot better
Just wait you'll see
That with your childish little frown
You were only bringing me down
Middle 8 
So smile like you mean it
Make me believe it
I am sick of you
You think that you're a knowitall
Pride comes before a fall
You're starting to undo
Bridge
I'll sing you a sad song
So you can drown your sorrows
Chorus
Just wait you'll be
A million miles away from me
When i say that i am
Feeling a whole lot better
Just wait you'll see
That with your childish little frown
You were only bringing me down
You're only bringing me down
All the world is a stage
Every book has a page with tear stains
Every painting a frame
All the memories portrayed in beautiful ways
All the stories you told me
Never one which i could be set free
And the moral was ugly
You refused to ever tell me you loved me

I lost a life
Waiting for you
To change your mind
Waiting for you
Go on take a stab at me
Take a blind stab into my heart
Do you know how we can
Rewrite the story from the start

I took apart all the morals
And i started to erase all of the chapters
I told the girl in the story
That for her happy ending we'd need to adapt her

I lost a life
Waiting for you
To change your mind
Waiting for you
Go on take a stab at me
Take a blind stab into my heart
Do you know how we can
Rewrite the story from the start

All the stories
That you told me
Can i be free
All the stories
That you told me
Can i be free

I lost a life

Waiting for you

To change your mind
Waiting for you

Go on take a stab at me

Take a blind stab into my heart
Do you know how we can
Rewrite the story from the startChorus
What were we thinking that we'd
Change the world in little time
What were we thinking that we'd
Turn the darkness into light
Verse 1
We were too young
To know what this means
And we we were too dumb
To let ourselves believe
And we stood by sides
We thought that we'd recognise
And we could draw lines
But it cuts reality too fine
Chorus
What were we thinking that we'd
Change the world in little time
What were we thinking that we'd
Turn the darkness into light
What were we thinking that we'd
Go back in time
It was intentional
We had our hearts full of life
Verse 2
It was too soon
To break down walls we'd built
And it it wasn't true
Or fair to throw all of the guilt
And now now it's too late
To backtrack on what's done
We won't hesitate
We'll burn brighter than the sun
Chorus
What were we thinking that we'd
Change the world in little time
What were we thinking that we'd
Turn the darkness into light
What were we thinking that we'd
Go back in time
It was intentional
We had our hearts full of life
Instrumental
Chorus
What were we thinking that we'd

What were we thinking that we'd
Change the world in little time
What were we thinking that we'd
Turn the darkness into light
What were we thinking that we'd
Go back in time
It was intentional
We had our hearts full of lifeStreet lights turn on one by one
My hope is descending like the sun
Try to tell myself there's
Freedom in the loneliness 
Always restless story of my life
Disconnected body clock's not right
Try to tell myself that I'mma get some sleep tonight
Found myself where I started this isn't where I want to be
The time that I find hardest always comes eventually
My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me till I fall apart
Nocturnal nocturnal nocturnal nocturnal
My demons are blocking out the light
And my mind is about to loose the fight
Why can't I find peace when a Caracal could sleep tonight 
Your absence isn't something that I choose 
The truth is you were never mine to loose 
Said that I feel lifeless tryna get away from you 
Found myself where I started this isn't where I want to be
The time that I find hardest always comes eventually
My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me till I fall apart
Nocturnal nocturnal nocturnal nocturnal
My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me till I fall apart

But I see through the faade
See the queen behind the guard
Gently you mask the fact that you disagree
Dealt a hand without your card
Had the joker from the start
You're yearning wearing thin
Searching for something
I know what you're hiding but they can't see what you've got
What you've got baby what you've got baby
Quit crying and stop trying to be someone you're not
What you're not baby what you're not baby
Maybe you can't see
Oh you're the masterpiece
In time you'll see the colours through your own eyes
You could take the perfect shot
Show the people what you've got
A far cry from insecurity and demise
When your tears come to a stop
You can look down from the top
You're yearning wearing thin
Searching for something
I know what you're hiding but they can't see what you've got
What you've got baby what you've got baby
Quit crying and stop trying to be someone you're not
What you're not baby what you're not baby
Maybe you can't see
Oh you're the masterpiece
What you got babyI can't stop
Whether you know or not
I ain't strong
And it's something in you that I'm depending on
Worth a shot
Even though I've lost the plot
I know it's wrong
But it's something in you that I'm depending on
Not going out tonight
Stay home until daylight
I'm hanging on for my life
I know myself all too well
Set myself up to fail
Is that what the future entails
You give nothing to me
There wasn't nothing that's not what I need
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I'm feelin' in love
With you here by my side
It seems like I can't do anything right
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I'm feelin' in love
Every day every day every day every day
Anyway anyway anyway anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Such a shame
Time for me to make a change
With what you've shown
Maybe you're just another stepping stone
Lost my name
Trying to put out this flame
I don't know
Maybe you're just another stepping stone
Not going out tonight
Stay home until daylight
I'm hanging on for my life
I know myself all too well
Set myself up to fail
Is that what the future entails
You give nothing to me
There wasn't nothing that's not what I need
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I'm feelin' in love
With you here by my side
It seems like I can't do anything right
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I'm feelin' in love
Every day every day every day every day
Anyway anyway anyway anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day every day every day every day
Anyway anyway anyway anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day every day every day every day
Anyway anyway anyway anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day every day every day every day
Anyway anyway anyway anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains

It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day every day every day every day
Anyway anyway anyway anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountainsThere's someone out there waiting for me
High mini fat skinny just wait and see
Don't call me lonely if you are too
In a big city take pity won't make the news
I'm advancing nothing to lose
Gogetter do better the right attitude
Do as I say not as I do
Got no money nobody to tell you the truth
When I wake up in the morning
I don't really want too much
See this song but as a warning
'Cause you're too far away to touch
Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Time's up there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine love 'cause I know I'mma live without it
Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Time's up there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine love 'cause I know I'mma live without it
So come on surprise me I don't care who
Your step missing time's ticking ain't got a clue
Something I said the way that I move
Strong passion hot passion too much for you
Don't complicate this simple to me
I've got it you want it but it might not come free
The sun falls slowly shadows of love
Get together now or never can't wait till dawn
When I wake up in the morning
I don't really want too much
See this song but as a warning
'Cause you're too far away to touch
Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Time's up there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine love 'cause I know I'mma live without it
Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Time's up there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine love 'cause I know I'mma live without itIt's not your bubble I'm bursting
But soon a penny's gonna drop
Every time we're conversing
I see your head about to pop
I'm looking at you don't like what I see
You need to touch ground 'til you're level with me
So you better hold it hold it down down
This is bigger than you it's bigger than me
You're stringing it out like a symphony
So you better hold it hold it down down down
This ain't the me show keep it on the low
Where's your superego
You let your head grow I tried to let you know
When I tell you how it is you don't like it
You don't like it you don't like it
I tell you how it is you don't like it
You don't like it you don't like it
I tell you how it is you don't like it no no no
So where's your superego
You're my girl so it's worth it
I'm gonna hit you with the truth
In this world no one's perfect
We're all consumed by what we do
I'm looking at you don't like what I see
You need to touch ground and get level with me
So you better hold it hold it down down
This is bigger than you it's bigger than me
You're stringing it out like a symphony
So you better hold it hold it down down down down
This ain't the me show keep it on the low
Where's your superego
You let your head grow I tried to let you know
When I tell you how it is you don't like it
You don't like it you don't like it
I tell you how it is you don't like it
You don't like it you don't like it
I tell you how it is you don't like it no no no
So where's your superego
So where's your superego
You've lost a part of your mind
A part that's hard to define
I'm tryna help you with your superego
You've lost a part of your mind
A part that's hard to define
I'm tryna help you with your superego
This ain't the me show keep it on the low
Where's your superego
You let your head grow I tried to let you know
When I tell you how it is you don't like it
You don't like it you don't like it
I tell you how it is you don't like it
You don't like it you don't like it
I tell you how it is you don't like it no no no
So where's your superego
So where's your superegoAnytime I'm alone I'm reliving the moment
Does it enter your mind
Have I already blown it
Somehow in my head it's overgrown
It's made me question everything I know
Did what you say contain an undertone
It goes on and on and on
It keeps turning up it won't leave me
Did I say enough Speak freely
Did my words destroy
Or was it just an afterthought
Was it just an afterthought
Was it just an afterthought
Was it just an afterthought
Oh was it just an afterthought
Was it just an afterthought
Was it just an afterthought
Was it just an afterthought
When you're so hard to read
I wonder what you're hiding
Lying under the leaves
I'm not someone you confide in
Somehow in my head it's overgrown
It's made me question everything I know
Did what you say contain an undertone
It goes on and on and on
It keeps turning up it won't leave me
Did I say enough Speak freely
Did my words destroy
Or was it just an afterthought
Was it just an afterthought
Was it just an afterthought
Was it just an afterthought
Oh was it just an afterthought
Was it just an afterthought
Was it just an afterthought
Was it just an afterthought
Afterthought afterthought
Get this get this sound
Set this set this downThe lights are too bright
Let's turn them down and get to work
You're in the limelight
But I'll flip the switch if you prefer
You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright I'll sit tight
Interconnected so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight it's not right
You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright I'll sit tight
Interconnected so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight it's not right
I'm attracted by the way you move
And now you got me drowning by the things you knew
And nothing can stop me
I'm disregarding the rules
It goes down to molecules
I'm not looking for the words to say
What you've already heard a hundred times
Too late I know that you got me
I'm disregarding the rules
It goes down to molecules
I know you want me
But I can act like I don't know
It's nearly morning
So grab your coat it's time to go
You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright I'll sit tight
Interconnected so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight it's not right
You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright I'll sit tight
Interconnected so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight it's not right
I'm attracted by the way you move
And now you got me drowning by the things you knew
And nothing can stop me
I'm disregarding the rules
It goes down to molecules
I'm not looking for the words to say
What you've already heard a hundred times
Too late I know that you got me
I'm disregarding the rules
It goes down to moleculesNever really felt bad about it
As we drank deep from a lie
Cause I felt melting magnets babe
The second I saw you through halfshut eyes
Smoke and sunset off Mulholland
He was talking I was wondering 'bout
You and that girl she your girlfriend
Face from heaven bet the world she don't know
Pretty girls don't know the things that I know
Walk my way I'll share the things that you want
Uhoh dancin' past the point of no return
Let go we can free ourselves of all we've learned
I love this secret language that we're speaking
Say it to me let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
Never really thought we would make it
We be thinking about what could have been
But we've had a record summer can't turn it down oh
Now I don't wanna see the envy again
Smoke and sunset off Mulholland
He was talking I was wondering 'bout
You and that girl she your girlfriend
Face from heaven bet the world she don't know
Pretty girls don't know the things that I know
Walk my way I'll share the things that you want
Uhoh dancin' past the point of no return
Let go we can free ourselves of all we've learned
I love this secret language that we're speaking
Say it to me let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no returnDon't say you want me don't say you need me
If you ain't ready turn around
Willing and able cards on the table
And I believe in what we've found
If we can't trust the love in us
There'll be no looking back no looking back no
If there's enough in stuff we touch
There'll be no looking back no looking back no
If we're falling in love we're falling in love
There'll be nothing above
And I won't give you up no I won't give you up
If we're falling in love
If we're falling in love we're falling in love
There'll be nothing above
And I won't give you up no I won't give you up
If we're falling in love
If you don't feel it the same as me
Speak now or hold your peace
If you don't see it the way I see
Then it was never meant to be
If we can't trust the love in us
There'll be no looking back no looking back no
If there's enough in stuff we touch
There'll be no looking back no looking back no
If we're falling in love we're falling in love
There'll be nothing above
And I won't give you up no I won't give you up
If we're falling in love
If we're falling in love we're falling in love
There'll be nothing above
And I won't give you up no I won't give you up
If we're falling in love
If we're falling in love
If I'm gonna fall in I'm gonna fall my all inYou made a promise I won't forget
You were dishonest ever since we met
If I could count the times you told me with love in your voice
That you'd make an honest choice
Don't you remember anything that you said
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Don't you remember anything that you said
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Such repetition cause for concern
I shouldn't listen but I never learn
If I could count the times you told me with love in your voice
That you'd make an honest choice
That you'd make an honest choice
Don't you remember anything that you said
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Don't you remember anything that you said
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
'Cause you're the echo that's in my head
'Cause you're the echo that's in my head
I've had I've had enough
Tryna find the space to interrupt
I've had I've had enough
All the different ways you hold me up
I've had I've had enough
Tryna find the space to interrupt
I've had I've had enough
All the different ways you hold me up
Me up me up me up me up
Me up me up me up me up
Don't you remember anything that you said

I thought that it would be easier than this
I found my heart had grown colder
But the warmth of your kiss I can't dismiss
Though my past has left me bruised
I ain't hiding from the truth
When the truth won't let me lie right next to you
But it's holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to make it
Played the part but I can't fake it
It keeps holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to break it
Heaven knows that I can't shake it
But it's holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to make it
Played the part but I can't fake it
It keeps holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to break it
Heaven knows that I can't shake it

It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
I've seen times that were harder
I remember the taste of bitterness
Won't you help me my father
Help me fall in the love that I have missed
Though my past has left me bruised
I ain't hiding from the truth
When the truth won't let me lie right next to you
But it's holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to make it
Played the part but I can't fake it
It keeps holding on
And it's holding strong

But there's no other way
You deserve the world I couldn't give you less
But I'm not perfect the way you're perfect
And though it hurts yeah it hurts to say goodbye
I know I let you down
It wasn't that your love wasn't good enough
Couldn't stick around
It's only in myself that I didn't trust
I had good intentions
I had good intentions
And it's a shame
Oh ironic that I went and put you through
I take the blame
'Cause the truth there's really nothing you could do
But I'm not perfect the way you're perfect
And though it hurts yeah it hurts to say goodbye
I know I let you down
It wasn't that your love wasn't good enough
Couldn't stick around
It's only in myself that I didn't trust
I had good intentions
I had good intentions
I had good intentions
I
But I'm not perfect the way you're perfect
And though it hurts yeah it hurts to say goodbye
But I'm not perfect the way you're perfect
And though it hurts yeah it hurts to say goodbyeI'm feeling something something different
When you left my picture changed
I was blinded I'd not envisioned
The same face in a different frame
It's an omen caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me without you I am lonely
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen
Oh omen
You were waiting I was vacant
You left before my eyes
Then it hit me you're relocating
And I need you by my side
It's an omen caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me without you I am lonely
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen
Oh
Omen

Oh
Omen

Oh
Omen

Oh
Omen

Oh omenYour words give you away
Be careful how you say my name
Step back refrain
Be honest when you save some face
'Cause you're fading
Don't mistake me for a fool
The game you play has changed
Take a look at yourself and the stories you tell
Does the truth weigh on your mind
Tell me what did it cost when the moment was lost
Is this how you survive
Why oh why do you have to lie
What are you afraid of
We know what you're made of
Now your time has passed you by
You've already made it
There's no need to chase it
So get up so get up and save it
'Cause enough is enough you're jaded
Your golden years left you behind
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them
The gospel that you preach
Is poisonous beyond belief
But still you'll reach
Be careful of the truth
My speak is amazing
When it's there in black and white for all to see
We sow and you reap
So take a look at yourself and the stories you tell
Does the truth weigh on your mind
Tell me what did it cost when the moment was lost
Is this how you survive
Why oh why do you have to lie
What are you afraid of
We know what you're made of
Now your time has passed you by
You've already made it
There's no need to chase it
So get up so get up and save it
'Cause enough is enough you're jaded
Your golden years left you behind
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
So get up so get up and save it
'Cause enough is enough
You're jaded
Your golden years left you behind
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn up town
No postcode envy
But every song's like

Gold teeth Grey Goose tripping in the bathroom
Bloodstains ball gowns trashing the hotel room
We don't care
We're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal Maybach diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes islands tiger's on a gold leash
We don't care
We're aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler
You can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule
My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And every one who knows us knows
That we're fine with this
We didn't come from money

But every song's like
Gold teeth Grey Goose tripping in the bathroom
Bloodstains ball gowns trashing the hotel room
We don't care
We're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal Maybach diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes islands tiger's on a gold leash
We don't care
We're aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler
You can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy 

And we'll never be royals 

I know you're smart you spin me round like a knot
You know the pieces pieces of my heart
Sometimes it's fun you pull my strings one by one
Until you get me get me onto one
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then lets play rough
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then lets play rough
I don't need you giving it straight to me

So we'll just talk and bum some smokes
Woke up you caught me with a smile
Passed out on your bathroom tile

So sad I should've told her something
Call her up and talk about nothing
But I forgot I lost my phone
And all my friends they just stay the same
I'm growing up but nothing's changing
I'm so sick of this stupid place
It's so suburban and so boring
I should try and get a life
But I don't want that 9 to 5

Wanna be that guy

And I'm still fucking broke
But I got bad habits

And all I got are bad habits
But they're my bad habits
And now I'm one week sober
And I'm still hungover
And maybe I should take a break
And I think I need help
'Cos I'm playing with myself
At least three times a day
And what's the bigfuckindeal
If I don't wanna feel
But I got some reservations about rehabilitation

I don't care if it's notSomewhere you are my everything my all
How could I ever forget how could I ever let you fall
I held you when life left you a piece of me then left too
A piece of me then left too
That day my soul turned inside out
I couldnt scream for her to stop though my whole body wanted to
Now Im left here without you
And your soul is one billion years away
Youre not here
Youre in your heavenly fields
Soon Im coming
Cant wait to see you running
I stopped counting one river ago
I miss you
Dont know how many tears that Ive cried
I miss you 75
She had been dancing around the corner for a while trying to get by
The year was seventy five You came around you saved the day
took her away then you locked her in And it all began Run oh run
Such a fool not to let her go
Dont say she never told you so
Such an idiot to let him in
What a way for it all to begin
Oh let her go
Shes just one number in the line nothing is fine now it is her
time to shine All curtains down She never had a chance
oh no one will see her dance again Run oh run
Such a fool not to let her go
Let her go
Such a fool not to let her goI cant let this feeling go
so I keep my anger burning
Til the day that I meet you again
I cant feel the summer
I cant feel the time pass me by
Youre on your own
Im not afraid
Now Im letting you go
I keep my head high and yours under water
Im not sorry its just one of those days
Im not sorry to say
that I havent thought about you lately
I cant see the point
of random hugs and kisses
Just let me be now
just let the time pass us by
Youre on your own
still Im not afraid
still Im letting you go
I keep my head high and yours under water
Im not sorry its just one of those days
I keep my I keep my I keep my I keep my
I keep my head high and yours under water
Im not sorry its just one of those daysIm strolling down a lonesome highway on my way to catch a dream
Its custom made for me my new best friend oh how I feel free
Yeah now Im going back with my head held high
Sweep me off my feet live for today
Let the stars of San Francisco lead the way
So one chance in a million still means there is a chance
Excitements in the air tonight a special feeling in these neon lights
One second were dancing the next were in a fight
Sweep me off my feet live for today
Let the stars of San Francisco lead the wayI still remember how it started at the barracks in the harbor
I was oh so young back then
When the music stole my soul I was hanging with you all
Yeah I was hooked from the start
Well in the end its where we meet at the same houses the same streets
I still believe in happy songs When its all chaos I sing along
Now theres time for you and me Were alive and were born free
Id give my everything to be a part of this
As time slowly changes bridges are burned
Id give my everything to
Well in the end its where we meetIm not struggling to survive
here every day is a joyride
Im one of the fortunate ones
And for that Im thankful
cause every day I see the less joyful
and now Ive got my hands full
everyday everyday everyday
Youre driving through the inner city
Through sunshine and through rain to take away the pain
So you can lean your head on me
not seventy million times but this one time
You could be one of the fortunate ones
And for that you should be thankful
Got lots to give but keep your pockets full
You keep your pockets full
If you cant stand up tall
get ready to fall
ready to fall
Youre driving through the inner city
Through sunshine and through rain to take away the pain
Youre driving through the inner city
Youre driving through the inner city
Through sunshine and through rain to take away the painHes going home Looks like the sky is burning his head is turning
At least hes on his way He will be there before morning
much explaining without warning
He passes the blue lights relieved they let him go
Why he never got home that night no one will know
There was this song we used to sing It used to make him happy
oh it always ended happy Why cant life just be a song
Where everyone is in love and the rest is a story untold
He passes the blue lightsCant understand some of those mothers
who dont even seem to bother to see their children
I often meet them and I wonder
why they cant see the kind of humble beautiful people they have made
Everythings wrong and undesirable
Open your eyes and see your miracle
Somebody said Im inconsiderate
Theres just some things I cannot tolerate
Somebody said
You never hold yourself responsible
but I work day and night to cover for your mistakes
Sometimes there is no given ending
Its ironic how its all depending on the things you dont say
Everythings just ugly and terrible
Open your eyes and see your miracle
Somebody said Im inconsiderateLets talk about the question of what you should or shouldnt think
I dont think you know it Cause youre drinking at their place
Make up your mind dont sit here wasting my time You just said youre a nazi
so why are you in my face
I feel my blood is pumping
My heart nearly stops forgets to beat
I know that he is watching
Though I try to ignore we always seem to meet
All of a sudden theres a guy in front of me
He said I heard you hate us oh but I wanna be your friend
Is this a fucking joke I will never understand
Why these guys these guys care about me
I feel my blood is pumping my heart nearly stops forgets to beat
I feel my blood is pumpin
I feel my blood is pumpin
I feel my blood is pumping my heart nearly stops forgets to beatOn the other side of the street
Theres some people I dont want to meet but still I meet them
Suddenly everythings out of control
Everyone is fighting and kicking and screaming while I start running
Tonight I was falling felt you coming from behind
Youre certainly one of a kind Now Im on the ground
Sometimes nothing turns out as planned
And this isnt one of those nights that I like to think of
For one second everything froze Im just glad it wasnt the day for me to go
Tonight I was falling
For one second everything froze
Everyone is fighting and kicking and screaming while I start running
Tonight I was fallingYou used to fly low
But now you're flying high
But what goes up must come down
That's why I'm leaving this old town
So bye bye bye baby baby bye bye
You know me me no good in your heart
That's why I'm singing this song
Bye bye baby bye bye
You don't want me around
That's why I'm leaving this old town
So bye bye bye baby baby bye bye
Bye bye bye baby baby bye bye
So long so long baby baby I must go
You know you told me you don't want me anymore
You told me to pack my clothes
You told me to hit the road
So bye bye bye baby baby bye bye
Bye bye bye baby baby bye bye
Bye bye bye baby baby bye bye
Bye bye bye baby baby bye byeI've got some good news honey

I knnooooowwWords to Song Wait Till It Happens to You
By Fats Domino from Album Fats is Back
BartholomewDomino
Just You Wait till it Happens to You
I can get no attentionand your arms love to pick on me
I just wonder why you do me like you do
Just you wait till it happens to you
Now youre sittin there and youre laughin
So I guess the jokes on me
I just wonder why you do me like you do
Just you wait till it happens to you
You knew how much I loved you
And you knew how much I really cared
One day youll wake up and youre feelin sad
Then youll realize the true friends that you hadLovely Rita meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita meter maid
May I ask discreetly
When do you free
To have a drink with me


Lovely Rita meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh Lovely Rita meter maid
Where will I be without you
Give me a wink and make me think of you

She came to me one morning one lonely Sunday morning
her long hair flowing in the midwinter wind
I know not how she found me for in darkness I was walking
and destruction lay around me from a fight I could not win
She asked me name my foe then I said the need within some men
to fight and kill their brothers without thought of men or god
And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies
so eager was my passion to devour this waste of life
But she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals
so easy to begin and yet impossible to end
For she the mother of all men had counciled me so wisely that
I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay
Oh lady lend your hand I cried Oh let me rest here at your side
Have faith and trust in me she said and filled my heart with life
There is no strength in numbers I've no such misconceptions
But when you need me be assured I won't be far awayDarlin' I am
Whatever you make me
So baby baby whatever you make me
Make me belong to you
I can't be your beggar or king
You've got the power
To make me anything
You've got the power
So open your heart it's up to you
It's up to you
Cause darlin' I am
Whatever you make me
So baby baby whatever you make me
Make me belong to you
I can't be your puppet on a string
You've got the power
To make me anything
You've got the power
So open your heart it's up to you
It's up to you
Cause darlin' I am
Whatever you make me
So baby baby whatever you make me
Make me belong to youIf your liver starts to jump
And your heart begins to thump
Man that's all
Another mule is kickin' your stall
Now if your girl stay out all night
Don't you get mad and start a fight
Cause man that's all
Another mule is kickin' your stall
Now if you come home and your food ain't cooked
And she give you a dirty look
Man that's all
Another mule is kickin' your stall
If your liver starts to jump
And your heart begins to thump
Man that's all
Another mule is kickin' your stall
Now if your girl stay out all night
Don't you get mad and start a fight
Cause man that's all
Another mule is kickin' your stall
Now if you come home and your food ain't cooked
And she give you a dirty look
Man that's all
Another mule is kickin' your stallThe sun's gonna shine in my back door someday
Just you wait and see just you wait and see
One day you'll cry I won't come back to you
Just you wait and see just you wait and see
You've got such a great big beautiful smile
I wanna hug and kiss you for a while
The sun's gonna shine in my back door someday
Just you wait and see just you wait and see
 FluteI'm back again
Mama know that papa grow on jelly beans
Takes good care but pulls his hair when he gets mean
Papa know that mama goes for fancy dress
If papa give her nothing but the very best
If papa give her nothing but the very best
Honest papas love their mamas better
Mama know where papa goes so he revived
Starts to croon is since his tune to ginny rock
Papa know that mama shows her love is strong
By waiting up for him until a early dawn
By waiting up for him until a early dawn
Honest papas love their mamas better
They laughin' laughin' loud together
And make their little world seems better
And after laughin' fun is fun
They kiss goodnight till the morning come
Honest papas love their mamas better
Papa know that mama goes for fancy dress
And papa give her nothing but the very best
And papa give her nothing but the very best
Honest papas love their mamas better
Honest papas love their mamas betterWhen you're smiling
When you're smiling
The whole world smiles with you
When you're laughing
When you're laughing
The sun comes shining through
But when you're crying
You bring on the rain
Stop your cryin' and be happy again
When you're smiling keep on smiling
And the whole world smiles with you
But when you're crying
You bring on the rain
Stop your cryin' and be happy again
When you're smiling keep on smiling
And the whole world smiles with youverse 1 I want one for the highway

Livin' in misery
If you see my mama
Tell her goodbye for me
If you see my mama
Tell her goodbye for me
Ya know I'm tired of livin'
Livin' in miseryLady Madonna children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Now who finds the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent
Friday night arrives without no suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his boot lace
See how they run
Lady Madonna lying cross your bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
See how they run
Lady Madonna children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Tuesday afternoon is never endingI see these old shoes dusty in a corner
How can I believe we're through
Not so long ago when these old shoes were newOh oh oh oh 
You've done me wrong you made me love you now you've gone

Is what I'm now paying for
The things I did and I saw
Would make a dream stand still

Don't call my name
It makes me feel so ashamed
I've lost my sweet helping hand
I've got myself to blame
Always lived a very quiet life
I ain't never done no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Been too lonely too long
One night of sin
Is what I'm now paying for
The things I did and I saw
Would make a dream stand still
I lived a very quiet life
I ain't never done no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Been to lonely too long
I want to walk you home
Please let me walk you home
I wants to walk you home
Please let me walk you home
You look so good to me ohoohee
I wish I was the lucky guy who could walk you right on down the aisle
I love the way you walk
I love to hear you talk
I love the way you walk
I love to hear you talk
I'm not tryin' to be smart I'm not tryin' to break your heart
But if I ask you for a date will you tell me that I'm not too late
I want to hold your hand
Please let me hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
Please let me hold your hand
You look so good to me ooooee

Now you come back'n knockin' on my door
I hear you knockin' but you came from him
I hear you knockin' go back where you've been
I begged you not to go but you said goodbye
Now you come back tellin' all those lies
I hear you knockin' but you came from him
I hear you knockin' go back where you've been
If you had a lesson long time ago
You wouldn't be goin' from door to door
I hear you knockin' but you came from him
I hear you knockin' go back where you've been
You went away and left me long time ago

From the east to the west

Let 'em blow let 'em blow
From the east to the west

Wake up sleepy head
Come on little darling

The school bell is ringing
Vacation time is gone
No more watching the late show
From now on
No more calling
Calling Judy on the telephone
No more going out swimming
Vacation time is gone
Hey little school girl
Your time is awful short
The tardy bell will catch you
Hurry or you'll be caughtHow long how long must I wait for you
How long how long must I wait for you
I'm sad when you're not around me
But 'ere's nothing I can do
It's been a long time
Since I had you in my arms
It's been a long time
Since I had you in my arms
You know I need your lovin'
So won't you please hurry homeOn Saturday night where I was born down on the farm
Guitar plinking and we started singing 'til the break of dawn
About twelve o'clock ev'rything gets hot up steps old Jones
We started clappin' and he started singin' a sweet little country song
Bo Weevil Bo Weevil where've you been all day
Your momma's been lookin' hasn't stopped lookin' since you went away
Bo Weevil Bo Weevil where did you go and stay
Your momma's been lookin' hasn't stopped lookin' since you went awayOh baby I'm tired of crying over you
Oh baby I'm tired of crying over you
I cried that I love you so
But that's where I ain't gonna cry no more
Yes you went away now you want to come back
No no no baby there ain't no day like that
I'm gonna be mean like you wanted to be
As I cried for you now it's your turn to cry for me
Yes you heard my song you heard it once before
No matter what you do you gotta reap what you sow
Yeah baby that's the way it's gonna be
As I cried for you now it's your turn to cry for meYou said you love me how come you treat me like you do
You said you love me how come you treat me like you do
You're acting baby like you'll find somebody new
I give you all of my money and all my loving too
I give you all my money and all my loving too
Now tell me baby tell me what more can I do
You got me worried you got me worried over you
Yes you got me worried you got me worried over you
If you don't come back to me I don't know what I'm gonna doIf you see Rose Mary tell her I'm coming home to stay
Tell her I'm tired of travelin' I just can't go on this way
Every night I traveled with my friends now I'm coming home to stay
So if you see Rose Mary tell her tell her I'm on my way
If you see Rosemary tell her I'm coming home to stay
I don't stand in line I don't pay for clubs Fuck that
But I wait for you
I don't like to drink I don't like to think Fuck that
But I ponder you
I'm bending it over
You're my four leaf clover
I'm so in love so in love
There's no one above up above
Forever's a long time yes

My blue jeans
Will last me all my life
So should we
I'm spending all this time

Met you at the shop Sun was getting hot I'm lonely
I'm in the city on my own
Never would've thought you'd be the one I got a homie
But that's the way it goes
I'm reaching Nirvana
Goodbye sweet Rwanda
High school was never for me
I say let it be let it be
Forever's a long time

My blue jeans
Will last me all my life
So should we
I'm spending all this time

You don't even know me
You don't even know me
I'm hanging from the tree
I'm hanging from the treeFeeling not all right
My time's in a sandslide
So hard not to unwind
Find some wall to climb
Capsules cover the signs
My thoughts in a land mine
Some lights burn too bright
My nights hold too tight
Slowed away outta breath
Won't wait to pass the test
Too late to answer lies
Don't even need to try
Livin' in a fury
Life's kinda blurry
Dtin' in a hurry
Stories kinda lurid
No time to worry
Gonna hang the jury
Broke up kinda early
All the bribes are working
Livin' in a fury
Life's kinda blurry
Dtin' in a hurry
Stories kinda lurid
No time to worry
Gonna hang the jury
Broke up kinda early
All the scribes are workingWalkin' down the long road
Ran into a strange man
Said he thought he'd borrowed
Bought himself a game plan
Shook my head and nodded
That's all I ever plotted
That's all they ever wanted
That's all they ever saw then
Pulled music together
Laughter forever
Now I hear the laughter
I've read every book in the bible story
And all is every brought me was
another worry
Don't want god give me a jury
Seethere's no God to make
up my mind
No God givin' me time
I peered in every window where
I saw a cross
But I could never see just what they saw
In that piece of plaster on the wall
Seethere's no God to fear
No God to hear your cries
I'd prey to anything out there
If only I was given some sign to bear
But while I wait I'm gonna live
Seethere's no God to watch over me
No God for human beings
When I small I obeyed
his every word
Handed down to me by some
thoughtful blur
But now I am as big as he
SeeNo God bigger than I
No God frightening me
In my image I made he him
and I gave him life
So he burned me
the creature has risen and I
Think you can see just what it is
that's drivin'
Me around round
We are the church we are good
we've got your
Millions God know we should
Standing in the line we're aberrations
Defects in a defect's mirror
And we've been here all the time
real fixations
Hidden deep in the furor
What we do is secretsecret
We're influential guys for the DCC
We can lie so perfect
And we've got a party line
to every call
It's a very short circuit
What we do is secretsecret
Licensed to drill with the torch
in our lives
Walking on shallow water
Progressed to the
point of no distinction
Dementia of a higher order
What we do is secretsecretI'm Darby Crash
A social blast
Chaotic master
I'm Darby Crash
Your meccas gash
Prophetic stature
I'm Darby Crash
A one way match
Demonic flasher
Deep deep deep in my eyes
There's a round round round
circle of lives
It's a tame tame tame sort of world
Where you're caught bought
taught as it twirls
I'm Darby Crash
A social blast
Chaotic master
Snap crackle pop
Snap crackle pop
Snap crackle popin here
Snap crackle pop
Snap crackle pop
Snap crackle popout thereLet me touch the tips of inculcated desire
And brush the fettered veil away
Shut down in the depths I lay
If you want nothin' then I've got nothin'
I'm your annihilation man
Lemme get control I've got your minds
now I want
Your souls lemme get control
I've got your minds
Now I want control I need control
If you want somethin' then
I've got somethin'
I'm your annihilation man
all the people that I get you can place your fucking bets
we don't need your fucking money
all you fucking english brats
you don't care wheree its atI feel your body's close to mine
I hear your breath and mine in time
I know I'm nothing but it's you that I need
I touch your skin and it starts to feed
You're not the first you're not the last
Another day another crash
My eyes meet yours in secret glance
Our bodies look in ancient stance
You whisper something and I
know it's good
You're acting crazy just like I
knew you would
You're not the first you're not the last
Another day another crash
Embracing my life between your thighs
We will perform in the deadly skies
Reducing my mind to endless nights
You send my dreams to their demise
Realized by your last vreath
I take your hair in to my hands
I pull it tight to fit your demands
feel my body in to yours
know it's right cause that's
my soul you stir
You're not the first you're not the last
Another day another crashAstrid was from a planet blue
He spoke of love for me and you
He could set your mind ablaze
With sparkling eyes and visionary care
He stood like a remnant from an outbreak past
Wore a ring in his ear and boy was he fast
Had hair like a rocket's nest
But when he cheered he gave his best
He made a noise that stirred our souls
Got us moving out of control
When Astrid moved he changed our tunes
They filled his arms with needles bare
Shot him up and cut his hair
Tied him to an evil plot
Told the kids that he was not
their man
He gave us life and dealt us love
Sold us out for the great above
On a starry night in midDecember
Astrid died you might remember
Live it to the end
Share it with a friend
Deny me not
Cause now you're caught
I'll be with you in the thought
BeyondJust a pill and a dream
Died yesterday
Put a gun in his mouth and blew his way out
Just a pill and a dream
It's a suicide machine
She danced all night to the storm in her mind
She waits in the gutter
Someone she'll never find
Just a sill and a scheme
It's a suicide machine
She cried about the world
She slit her throat to fight it
Someone had told her she'd had it
Just a sill and a scheme
It's a suicide machine
Bobby had lost his secret identity
He saw his masculinity in a glass of Bordeaux
Just watch the show
It's a sparkler to his child eyes
It's a suicide machine
You find his wish
Get yourself some ammunition
Click
It's a suicide machineThough your dark eyes you can feel my every sin
When I walk right into a straight line this world of yours
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again
You're the fall guy in the corner of my gloom
And it feels like everything I see is nothing new
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again
There's a door there that opens without you
And the door lies with open keys to my room
Flame of the torchlight fill my thighs fulfill
As I crave I consume 'em but I don't give
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye againi'm richie dagger
i can stomp and swagger
i can take on all your heroes
i'm richie dagger
i'm young and i'm haggard
the boy that nobody owns
he sits in his corner like a child despised
a crazy sort of cast comes over his eyes
thats richie daggers crime
he's that sort of boy that was never much loved
his idea of fun was society's grudge
thats richie daggers crime
his life was such a mess
and his friends werent quite the best
but he was satisfied
thats richie daggers crime
suck me in and spit me out
devour me in haste

he could set your mind ablaze
with sparkling eyes and visionary case
he stood like a remnant from an outbreak past
wore something in his ear
and boy was he a sass
All he sees are death masked stars
The lion's world is cold and sharp
All he wants is much too far
So he stalks thw roads of token cars
He snarls at winds that mean no harm
And takes the thorns in perfect form
A broken ideal rides inside the torture
Lion's denim hide
I want the lion's share
Gather up the broeken chairs
Feed my mind unholy tests
Do me in I need to rest
He sleep swhen nothing's in the air
Eats the scraps of some that care
He strains the right to overbear
Secrest hidden in the liar
Pauses long enough to dream
Nightmares push the glowing scream
His shadowed eyes show the toll
Something only lions knowSifting through apocalypse
All I want's to catch a glimpse
Just another broken day
My whole world's gone away
I feel the ceilings coming down
I catch the deadmen run around
Trying hard to chnage the course
'cuase they know what's best for us
Your whole world's coming down
Close to the bottomclose to the sound
Your whole world's let me down
Drag me down to the under ground
Sifting through apocalypse
Already new it would come to this
Just another game to play
How mnay ways have I got to play
Hear them running faster now
They wear the hoove's of Satan's crowd
You came to visit for just one day
But now that you're here
You're here to stayI'm crawling through my tunnel
When everything is dim
where does one go
I crawl in to my tunnel
It's kinda shaky may even crumble
I'm talking to a lame man
When you're maimed
where does one go
I fall into my tunnel
I'm walking into the jungle
When everything is right
where does one go
I walk into the jungle
Sometimes I runsometimes I stumble
I'm talking to a saved man
When you are sane
where does one go
Back into the jungle
Out out out of the tunnel
Back Back to the jungle
Out out out of the tunnel
Take me back to my jungleI've got television
I've got supervision
No decisons for you
Media blitzmedia Blitz
Immediate hitswe rule
Don't steal your eyes off the TV screen
Can you realize we're what we've seen
Take an injection from the mad machine
Don't read the papers read between the lines
We're vision rapers and we seed the signs
You'll play your part in the master mind
We feed the science
We deal in riots
We play by ideal time
We're a gov'ment fix
All social convicts
Watch the idle rhymes

Bleed your heart outthat's all it's worth
Before you ever startwe planned it first
Forget the truthaccept your curse
I just like it let me have this dance
Ya your jumping had a crazy sound
An it'll start runningto look him down
Sound so neatjust give me a chance
Move out of my seat just hear that dance
Start pushin my feetand clap your hands
just don't like it goin up and down
Ya there's really somthingwith a crazy sound
And you'll start running now to look him down
about 12 o' clock oh god I'm drunk
The place is sacked it the front lot
But this night I just don't like
just don't like it goin up and down
Ya there's really somthingwith a crazy sound
And you'll start running now to look him down

About 12 o' clock oh god I'm drunk
The doors are locked the place is packed
But this night I just don't like
just don't like it goin up and down
Ya everywhere I am with a crazy sound
And you'll start running now to look him downI'm looking through
Communist eyes
I'm seeing planes in bloodshot skies
I see the flag of a working people
Who conceal the lies in the stars
and sickle
It's a double edge
Communist eyesc'mon inside
I can't ever find the way out
Communist eyeslost inside
I never get a day out
I'm looking through Communist eyes
All I see is an old man's alibi
There's a world outside
but I'm unaware
I open my books but the pages stare
It's a double edge
Communist eyesall so blind
I can't even play the game nowLand of treasonwaste no reason
we are breathing fire
We're packs of dogs
we're enemies of menwe are not desired
Our face show
we've grown coldbut
have not conspired
Old hearts gone
the future's onmother nations mired
I like a recepticle for the chosen dead
we find our bodies clawed
And with the scent of death
we find that we are not so very awed
Loyalties burned
the words our blurredoverturn your own
Walk like dogs and watch the doors
have your other stone
Stop the toys that match disordered
calculate the thrones
Feel the pulse descending
decaying hallowed tomes
In the starving sense you worship
the nations of debris
You wear a cost of sewage
that you've never ever seen
The time is nowthe vicious here
a stolen dinner code
The license of the savage land
that you've always sold
So bite the hand that needs you
and bless another coal
The virus never issues
from a cotton so very old
As the lights come down
You wash your hands and start to climb
the ladder that you stole
Slip the hatchand spin the sword
the money lords are poor
Push the tanthat rolls downhill
their sense of dream absorbed
Still the cat that breaks the night
tie him to the core
Chase the viruses that believe
that what's right is scored
It's a senseless cash in of right for right
what's wrong is never gone
And left is just a bassion for the fools
golden dawnBilly Druids face is marble
He keeps veery thought in its place
He lets the days turn tomorrow
Someone's always walking
on his grave
He wears the lines just like Garbo
And talks at a saturmine pace
Listening to the strange notes marvel
Only giving what it takes
It's a sad man's world
And for Billy it's sure to crown
Dragging beauty into darkness
Inflciting a pale white frown
And the matter the runs
Through Billy's head
Is too concerned to fallClara would be proud to know us
We've taken it to the end
Where the grey tuens to black
And the white just begins
We live everyday on the water
The night just kills the pain
From the suffering that was
We are no strongerwe are dust
Down in the crowd we're down
on our knees
Wanna get out but
don't wanna succeed
We're the redeyed legends
of the night before
We're the dead mind babies
of the TV war
Living in a rectory of sin
Against the currents we all swim
Cageless wonders of sometime when
The paper icon's chase will endI'm a Lexicon devil with a battered brain
Searching for a future the world's my aim
So gimme gimme your hands gimme gimme your minds
Gimme gimme your hands gimme gimme your minds
Gimme gimme this gimme gimme that
I want toy tin soldiers that can push and shove
I want gunboy rovers that will wreck this club
I'll build you up and level your heads
We'll run it my way cold men and politics dead

I'll get silver guns to drip old blood
Let's get this established joke a shove
We're gonna wreak havok on this rancid mill
I'm searchin' for somethin' even if I'm killed

Empty out your pockets you don't need their change
I'm giving you the power to rearrange
Together we'll run to the highest prop
Tear it down and let it drop away
I'm the only thing you need
I'm so real you can feel me bleed
I'm the coat you left behind
I'm the one you'll never find
Get a grip get a grip on me
On the streets another thing
I'll push your knife and pull your string
Put your thoughts into my mind
I'll show your things of another kind
Get a grip get a grip on meLooking for a way out
I put my foot out of line
Really like to breakout
I feel so confined
American leather
The poinsous members
Not alonenot together
Their American leather
Saw you on a dark road
Brought myself along
Got a sense of conflict
But I know what's wrong



I know that kinda feeling
So I built my place up high
But you'll never find me kneeling
Cause I'm too occupied
It's Sunday and the streets aren't clear
The traffic's screaming
but we can't hear
The soundsthe metals
driving us mad
The soundsthe metals
driving us mad
We must bleed we must bleed
we must bleed
The crash as the bottle breaks
Flashes it will through my veins
The painthe colors
making me sane
The painthe colors
making me sane
the painthe colors
making me sane
We must bleed we must bleed
we must bleed
I'm not one I'm two I'm not one
I'm two I'm not one I'm two
I want out now I want out now
I want out now now now now now
now now nowYou walk to the temple on the boulevard
You know the way in cause you're
The son of God
She opens the door with
A sardonic glance
You drop to the floor making your plans

It's a real cool parody
That's my dragon lady
In a low society with no variety
She lives a tongue on cheek dream
There's something in her eyes
That nature denied
She's a whirlwind creature of cultural ties
A preacher of schemes and self denial
She talks up a storm with news and belial
Out on the streets what ya lookin' for
That thing in your bed's
just another whore
That tear in your eyes not a tear at all
For that girl that you touch
you could never fall
That stream in your mind it's a tearin' sty

Let's pretend you're vicious
Let's pretend you're cool
Let's pretend suspicious
Let's pretend you're fools
Your leather is tight but you wear it full
'Gether is right but you gotta be cool
You cut your wrists
but you don't feel the pain
You change your mind
but you still feel the same
To dream ain't your kind just another lie

Sell us a story that we can believe
Spend your dollars on pills for relief
Love is a future that you still can't see
Standing answers to questions are free
Scream in your boredom life's just to die

Dive in problems just like stealin' a fix
Is your life to live or is it for kicks
Kick dirt in the faces of angry dream men
Stand on your chairs and spell
don't let me in
Son't stand in the light
cuz you know
you can't cry

I've been looking looking so far
You've been listening listening so hard
I've been talking stalking all night
You've been thinking thinking I'm right
I've been missing missing some parts
I've been calling calling it art
We've been lurking lurking for clues
We've been whistling whistling for you
Trying to make some kinda sense out of it
Throw it away throw it away
Trying to make some kinda sense out of it
Throw it away throw it away
Don't know what I really got
Don't know if I even thoughtI came into this world
As a puzzled panther
Waiting to be caged
But something stood in the way
I was never quite tamed
Crossed paths of right and wrong
Saw them take their toll
I saw the armies march
And like animals they crawled
Evolution is a process
Too slow to save my soul
I've got this creature on my back
It just won't let go
Ha ha ha
If I am only an animal
Then I can do no wrong
But they say something better
So I've got to hang onIt starts in your head
And moves to your hands
Your body starts shakin'
Cuz you're in demand
You do the slave to the beat
Of the neurosutra can can
You're lashed 'twixt the stars
With your ice and motor cars
You do the slave to the beat
Of the neurosutra can can
Oh yea Yea Pull out the zen
I've got a Buddhist principle in my hand
Your life seems wasted your bodies laced in
Don't stop now you've got to trace it
You put your hands together
Writhe in the shackle
You twist your body round
Till it starts to crackle
You do the slave to the beat
Of the neurosutra can can
Right here right now shake it in and out some
Lights on off now make it spin and fight nowDown to the feline den I crawl
to join the feline force that waits
I strike a sort of katsy stance
as they look into my catlike face
From behind their sable masks
Not a purring sound is heard
Their luminous eyes catch my every word
Tonight's the night the tables turn
You've had your chance and now at last
You've been found guilty by the order of the cat
You've changed our laws and now because of that
Your going to live in the claws of a cat
Talons on and operating
We're sure that you're cooperating
Straighten up that feline face
And put your footsie pads in place
Practice up your katsy glance
And imitate my cat like stance
Tonight's the night the cats return
We'll corner them by the alley wall
Bite and scratch them until they fall
Lap their blood and steel their young
Finish them off just for fun
Tonight's the night the cats will run
Mommy I hear the cat at the door
I think he's cold will you let him in
Lay them out and leave our mark
A cat scratch angle above the heart
On we'll go to another house
To play the game of cat and mouse
Why do you plead when we don't care
We're the cats and we don't scare
You've had your turn and now it's ours
We're the cats and we've got clawsRip them down
Hold me up
Tell them that
I'm your gun
Pull my trigger
I am bigger than
Mr Prez in his big White House
Listen he says we're comin' out
Infiltrationwe're numbin' your minds
Concentrationwe've done time

Over there the Queen she says
Let's stamp them out and dry
Those tears
Saturationwe want in taxes
Flagelationwe've got gashes

In the cold the czars claimin'
Just protectin' rockets aimin'
Alterationthe word is changin'
Observationwe want action

I the Emperor proclaim
Us the masters we rule the game
Inclinationsomethin' to dream on
Deprivationwe are sons
I take it anywhere any time that I can
I am the fucking son of a superman
I got a weapon that's as deadly as life
It's a well trained tool a master guy
Every day it's the same regime
A dozen girls are on my scene
Say sex boy will you come into my hand
They're all on the floor I better do what I can
Take a number it's supply and demand
Anytime that I can
I'm the fucking son of a superman
I got a weapon that's as deadly as life
It's a well trained tool a master guy
I put my knife into your gut
You gotta be above when you're above
Wanna make love
Say it exactly sex boy such a sideshow poster
After such a sweet sweet slut
Any time that I can
I'm the fucking son of a superman
I know what it takes
What in the time that I can and can't do
I know what it takes to satisfy you
I know what it takes
That's why your time is due
In the house of fortune
I take it out and you know
It's gonna come from behind
Just like you and you and you and youIn your burning tight leather you're a firebomb
with your handles smoking you're on fire
not a flaw not a mess you're way on top
like a classic car a firebomb
you got your father worried your mother uptight
in a fire moon winter she's my love
the way you finger my flame you're a firebomb
the way you blow out my brain you're a firebombTake it to the teacher take it to the park
want to make a million is it armageddon
like to hear the voice in got nothing to say
got nothing more to say to you got nothing to do
standing in the light field ground zero out of reach
don't want no pardon
armageddon
technicians on the moon feel safer than you
standing like the targets in midst of armageddon
standing in the light field ground zero out of reach
don't want no pardon
armageddonWell that last train done left town
That last train done left town
I heard the whistle moaning low
But that last train done gone down
My sweet baby's on that train
My sweet baby's on that train
I wonder if I will see her again
Oh that last train done gone down
I heard the whistle moanin' low
I heard the whistle moanin' low
I beg and pleaded please don't go
But that last train done gone down
I'm sorry for what I've done
I'm sorry for what I've done
Too late goodbye my baby cried
Oh that last train done left townSunrise
Sunset
Since the beginning it hasn't changed yet
People fly high begin to lose sight
You can't see very clearly when you're in flight
It's high time that you found
The same people you misuse on your way up
You might meet up
On your way down
Vintage wines from the year '62
It's your thing it's your thing
It pleases you
You got to frown when you cross town
You think it's an honor just to have you around
It's high time that you found
The same dudes you misuse on your way up
You might meet up
On your way down
You think the sun rises and sets for you
But the same sun rises sets and shines
On the poor folks too
I don't mind you turning round
I myself would even like a little higher ground
It's high time that you found
The same people you walk on on your way up
You might meet up
On your way down
On your way downWith you in mind things just ain't bad as they seem
With you in mind I can fill my wildest dreams
With you in mind I can do anything I know I can
With you in mind
With you in mind
With you in mind I went out looking for the best
With you in mind cause you deserve nothing less
With you in mind I've done so many things that love can bring
With you in mind
With you in mind
Like a flower drinking from the falling rain
Or the same rain that could wash it away
Gives it strength gives it water
And before you know another day
Like a flower drinking from the falling rain
Or the same rain that could wash it away
Gives it strength gives it water
And before you know another day
Like a flower drinking from the falling rain
The same rain that could wash it away
Gives it strength gives it water
And before you know another dayFrom a whisper in the wind to a loud scream
The message came that I've lost you
To the warmth of another man
For heaven sakes girl don't do this to me
I've seen more tears fall from your eyes
Than all the showers of April
I took kindness for granted
As if it came with the wallpaper
So inconsiderate of how much you cared
For some stupid reason I just thought you had to be there
But oh my love you've lost it
Oh my love she's gone
My love you've lost it
She's long gone
For heaven sakes girl don't do this to me
I simply must have been crazy
I must have been out of my mind
To overlook the need in you
How could I have been so blind
Never giving thoughts to your wants and needs
But now I'm begging my baby please please please
But oh my love you've lost it
Oh my love she's gone
My love you've lost it
So inconsiderate of how much you cared
For some stupid reason I just thought you had to be there
But oh my love you've lost it
Oh my love she's gone
My love you've lost it
She's long goneI love the way you love to live
You got life you're inspiration
I love the way that you do
Your heart's so freely
You're a sweet sensation
You're my invitation to happiness
You're full of sweet surprises happiness
You fill my heart desire
More more more and more
And over and over again
Keep that goodness coming
I love the way you watch the world
Through kind eyes
That's why you're never sad sad
Things don't bother you like dos don'ts and whys
You hold on to the good and you let the bad go by
Yeah yeah
Happiness
I want your love forever
Happiness
Give me your love forever
More more more and more
And over and over again
Keep that goodness coming
Happiness

More more more and more
And over and over again
Keep that goodness coming
Keep it coming keep it coming
Keep it coming coming

Keep it keep it comingWhen a cold chill begins to burn at your very soul
That's the sweet touch of Love
When just the drop of a name begins to sting your very toe
That's the sweet touch of Love
Just the thought about seeing you would blow my mind
That's the sweet touch of Love
I was about to give up but you came just in time
With your sweet touch of Love
You brought out the best in me
Made me leave the rest of me behind
Oh yes you did
You delivered me from lonelyness
And onlyness ooh yes
And Oh little girl I want
One little kiss to let me know girl
That I couldn't live without your love you know it's true
I've found the joy that I had been missing for so long
It was the sweet touch of Love
When a cold chill begins to thrill your very soul
That's the sweet touch of Love
When just the drop of a name begins to sting your very toe
That's the sweet touch of Love
You know that there's nothing that's sweeter than you
I got to have you early in the morning
And when the icy wind ablow from the north
I don't need no clothes I don't need no coat
I got you early in the morning
I got you late in the afternoon
I got you late in the evening too
I got you
When ever my love come's tumbling down
And you know you got to be there
You can use the rest of this world of mine
And you know you got to be there
When my love come's tumbling down
And you know you got to be there
When my love come's tumbling down
And you know you got to be thereWell I tried to run my game
She said Man that's the same old thing I've heard before
And I'm too tired to go for your show

And she started to explain
She said Man I ain't sayin'

Play somethin' sweet and make it funky

Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues

She said Don't get upset

It's enough to make it light the dark
It's enough to make a bite just a bark
It's enough to make a body move around
It's enough to make a rabbit hug a dog
Play somethin' sweet
Well I tried to run my game
She said Man that's the same old thing I've heard before
And I'm too tired to go for your show

And she started to explain
She said Man I ain't sayin'

Lord have mercy what you gonna do about the people who are praying to you
They got men making laws that destroy other men
They've made money God
It's a doggone sin
Oh Lord you got to help us find the way
Big ship's asailing slaves all chained and bound
Heading for a brand new land that some cat said he upped and found
Lord have mercy what you gonna do about the people who are praying to you
They got men making laws that destroy other men
They've made money God
It's a doggone sin
Oh Lord you got to help us find the way
Some sing a sad song
Some got to moan the blues
Trying to make the best of a home
That the man didn't even get to choose
Lord have mercy how you gonna be with people like John and me
They've got men building fences to keep other men out
Ignore him if he whispers and kill him if he shouts
Oh Lord you got to help us find the way
Oh Lord you got to help them find the way
Oh Lord you got to help us find the wayI may do things you don't understand
But remember I'm only doing the best I can
Every little thing I do
I'm trying to get closer to you
Nearer nearer
I'm sorry if I seem a little bit stubborn sometimes
I hope I'm not being a nuisance to you
I know you say that you'd be home soon
I've got to be nearer nearer to you
Every deed I do
I'm trying to get closer to you
Nearer nearer
I know you say that you'd be home soon
I've got to be nearer nearer to you
I've got to be nearer nearer to you
I've got to be nearer nearer to youIt's raining so hard
Looks like it's going
To rain all night
And this is the time
I'd love to be
Holding you tight
I guess I'll have
To accept the fact
That you are not here
I wish tonight
Would hurry up and end
My dear
It's raining so hard
It's really coming down
Sittin' by my window
Watchin' the rain
Fall to the ground
This is the time
I'd love to be
Holding you tight
I guess I'll just go
Crazy tonight
It's raining so hard
Brings back memories
Of the times
When you were
Here with me
Counting every drop
About to blow my top
I wish this rain
Would hurry up
And stop
I've got the blues
So bad
I could hardly
Catch my breath
The harder it rains
The worst it get
This is the time
I'd love to be
Holding you tight
I guess
I'll just go
Crazy tonightRock roll rock roll
You take some music music
Sweet flowin' music
Some movin' and groovin'
Rock and roll will stand
Take some heart beats drum beats
Finger poppin' and stompin' feet
Little dances that look so neat
You see why it will stand
Some folks don't understand it
That's why they don't demand it
They're out tryin' to ruin
Forgive them for they know not what they're doin'
Don't nickname it
You might as well claim it
It swept this whole wide land
Rock and roll forever will stand
Hear those sax blowin'
Sharp as lightnin'
Hear those drums beatin'
Loud as thunder
Some folks don't understand it
That's why they don't demand it
They're out tryin' to ruin
Forgive them for they know not what they're doin'
Don't you nickname it
You might as well claim it
It will be here for ever and ever
Ain't gonna fade
Never no never
It swept this whole wide land
Sinking deep in the heart of man
Come on boy join our clan
Come on boy take my hand
Come on boy be a man
'Cause rock and roll will stand
Let's do it all over again
I feel good let's do it again
It'll be here for ever and ever
Ain't gonna fadeWent to a fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head
Said she'd take a look at my palm
She said son do you feel kind of warm
And she looked into her crystal ball
And said you're in love
I said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
She said when the next one arrives
You be looking into her eyes
I left there in a hurry
All looking forward to my big surprise
The next thing I discovered
The fortune teller told me lies
So I ran back to that woman
Mad as I could be
I told her I didn't see nobody
Why she made a fool out of me
Then something struck me
As if it came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love
Now I'm a happy fellow
I'm married to the fortune teller
We're happy as we can be
And now I get my fortune told for freeYour pretty brown eyes
Your wavy hair
I won't go home no more
'Cause you're not there
I'm telling you now
Like I told you before

Don't leave me no more

Won't you come on home

Won't you come back home

well just for the record let me set you straight
do me wrong and I'll put you down
girl I wouldn't even hesitate
I'm in love with you
but no more changes am I going through
stop playing foolish games
or tomorrow I may not feel the same
I see where you're coming from
coz I'm nice to you you think I don't
Don't mistake kindness for weakness
I know all the things you're not
If you still think your game is strong
girl well it's not all that hot
you better act like you're for real
before you blow a real good deal
stop playing foolish games
or tomorrow I may not feel the same
i know youre fooling around
you see because your friends they keep being in touch
but couldn't you be a little bit more discrete
or am i asking you for much too much
you see the pain and the hurt is getting stronger
I can't take it too much longer
stop playing foolish games
or tomorrow I may not feel the sameAnd I wake up in the mornin'
With my hair down in my eyes and she says Hi
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are goin' off to school goodbye
And she reaches out 'n' takes my hand
And squeezes it 'n' says How ya feelin' hon
And I look across at smilin' lips
That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun
And if that's not lovin' me
Then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss
Or Disneyland and Mother Goose no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when my self is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy
And ask her if she could get away and meet me
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me
'cause she's made that way
And if that ain't lovin' me
Then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes
And there's no such thing as makebelieve
Puppy dogs autumn leaves 'n' BB gunsNothing can stop me
So bad do I feel inside
Get my hat Im checkin out
Cause you and your friends really hurt my pride
So unexspected you shot me down
With all the fellas standing around yeah
Please dont go thats what theyll be saying
Please dont go But Im not playing
Cause nothing can stop me


Nothing can stop me
Though you and I where pretty close
Im calling it quits girl
Cause it was you I really dug the most
You made me feel like I was two feet tall
While all the others laughed and squalled yeah
Please dont go thats what theyll be saying
Please dont go But Im not playing
Cause nothing can stop me
Dont mind me havin the blues

The man you see before you ain't broken
Though the scars of my passion run deep
They say love can move mountains
But I gave up counting those lonely nights
Without you
losing sleep
Can't you see I fought so hard to get you
I sure ain't gonna let get away
There's only one principle

But you won't cure the hurting
There ain't such a thing as a better life without me
Can't you see I've been
I've been here before you
I've been down this lonely road of shame
Oh
I've spent my life learning
twisting and turning
And you can win if you play by the rules of the game
No matter what you do
hold on to whatever makes our love grow  
For goodness' sakes

Don't throw what we've got away
You've been a lover

Cities aflame in the summer time and oh the beat goes on
Eve of destruction tax deduction
City inspectors bill collectors
Evolution revolution gun control the sound of soul
Shootin' rockets to the moon kids growin' up too soon
Politicians say more taxes will solve ev'rything and the band played on
Round and round and around we go where the world's headed nobody knows
Great googa mooga can't you hear me talkin' to you just a
Ball of Confusion that's what the world is today 
Fear in the air tension ev'rywhere
Unemployment rising fast the Beatle's new record's a gas

Ball of Confusion that's what the world is today
Let me hear you let me hear you let me hear you
Ball Of Confusion that's what the world is todayChildhood part of my life it wasn't very pretty
You see I was born and raised in the slums of the city
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep
It was hard times
Needed something to ease my troubled mind
Listen my father didn't know the meaning of work
He disrespected mama and treated us like dirt
I left home seekin' a job that I never did find
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine
I'm doin' fine up here on cloud nine
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine up here on cloud nine
Folks down there tell me
They say give yourself a chance son don't let life pass you by
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive
It's a dog eat dog world and that ain't no lie
Listen it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night
I'm doin' fine on cloud nine
Let me tell you about cloud nine
Cloud nine you can be what you wanna be
 you ain't got no responsibility
And ev'ry man ev'ry man is free
 and you're a million miles from reality
I wanna say I love the life I live
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine
I'm riding high
On cloud nine you're as free as a bird in flight
 there's no diff'rence between day and night
 it's a world of love and harmony
 you're a million miles from reality
Cloud nine you can be what you wanna be
Cloud nine you ain't got no responsibility
And ev'ry man ev'ry man is free
 and you're a million miles from reality
 I decided to take a stand
not knowing I'd lose my best friend
But I'd rather live right
than in hell lift up my eyes
Stand
Stand
you stand
Stand for holiness
stand for righteousness
and be counted among them
that shall reign with Him
You stand when friends are gone
stand when you're all alone
and believe He shall receive His own
Stand
You standI've got a lover way over there on the mountain side
And I know that's where I should be
Don't you know

I can hear her calling to me
Oh she's calling my name
So sweet so plain I can hear her saying

I'm on my way

I'm gonna stay

They tell me that the river's too deep
And it's much too wide
Boy you can't get over to the other side
But they don't know I got to get there
And hold her in my arms just one more time
Like I did before when she was mine all mine
'Cause I hear her saying

Oh let me tell you
Time is the one thing everybody feels
It just expires with no regards to years
They say time can bring about a change 
But I ain't see a doggone thing
But they say

That's what they tell me

Oh every day they tell me y'all
I keep hearing them saying

It's in the answer that's what people say
But it looks like peace is getting further away
Together we stand and divided we fall
But we are still divided by that unseen wall
But they say


That's what they tell me

Ever since I was a little bitty boy they say it

That's what they tell me

Everyday I hear the same the same old thing
They say time
They say time
They say time
They say time
But I wanna know y'all
How much time does it really take
Before this world of ours is in a better shape
Somebody tell me
Well well well
The day when time brings on that blessed change
On that day the whole world will sing
Time will have washed all our fears away
And peace will have brought us a brand new day

But it takes time
That's what they tell me

Every day I keep hearing them telling me that

That's what they tell me

Oh Lord I wanna know nowYahoo

And the moon comes out of hiding to share its light
I think about the things we used to do
The way you held me when our love was new
But it's no use in going back through the years
There's nothing left for me but tears tears tears tears
Everywhere I go it seems I see your smiling face 
But when I get home there's nothing but empty space
That single cigarette we used to share
The time we wasted when I thought you cared
How can I face this life without you near
A life that only holds tears tears tears tears
Who'd ever thought we would be going going our separate ways
We promised love forever but where oh where is love today 
Do do do do
Darling if you'd ever change your mind
Come back and we will leave the past behind
I'll wipe away your doubt dispel all your fears
But please don't leave me here with tears tears tears tears
But even though my heart is breaking I wish you love
May you find the happiness that we both dreamed of
Do do do doThe magic of your kiss is holding you like this is ecstasy 
The love that you have given makes this life Im livin ecstasy 
Never let me go let that love light show
Ah take me by the hand and lead me to the land of ecstasy 
The first time that I saw you you showed me the door to ecstasy 
Now I just keep prayin that youre always thinkin ecstasy

And no matter how different they might be
Always runs across the same problem at least once
And that's the problem of love
And maybe just once in your life
You're gonna fall in love with somebody so bad
And it's gonna be somebody that don't need you at all
Somebody that's got everything in the world there is to have
And and you got nothin'
I I who have nothing I I who have no one
Adore you and love you so
I'm just a no one with nothing to give you but love
I love you
And then you guys
You're gonna have to tell her something too
So you walk up to that girl and you say
He he buys you diamonds bright sparkling diamonds
But believe me hear what I say
He can buy you the world but he'll never love the way
I love you
Listen here
He can take you any place he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
While I can only watch you with
My nose pressed up against the window pane
And then just when you think
That everything that you've gone and done
And everything that you've said has worked
And then you find out it didn't work at all
And when you're all alone you're gonna think
About that person that you sought so bad
And you're gonna turn out the lights
And you're gonna cry all to yourself
I I who have nothing I I who have no one
Must watch you go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else when darling it's I
Who loves you who loves you
Who loves youYou asked me to forget about you
Go out and find someone new
That won't be easy you see
After all the things you've done for me
Though I'm a man I ain't too proud to say
With you I stand tall and strong
Without you girl I'm nothing at all
Like a snowman in the sun my life was wasting away
Your love gave me hope and strength you're the reason I'm alive today
How I wanna know
How can I forget ya woman
After all you've done for me
You'll always be a part of me
Girl you don't realize what your love means to me
It's more precious than the air I breathe
I wanna know how
How can I forget ya woman
After all you've done for me
Girl you'll always be apart of me
How I wanna know
How can I forget ya woman
After all you've done for me
You'll always be apart of me

You've been so good good baby
How can I forget ya
It's impossible to do
How can I forget ya woman
You've been so good good good to me
How can I forget ya
I want to know
How can I forget yaAround the corner ten storeys high
There lives an angel who caught my eye
I want to know her but me oh my
I'm not allowed to join the crowd
around the corner 
Around the corner my shining star
has pretty dresses a fancy car
But I'm in trouble the way things are
Because I know I shouldn't go
around the corner 
Everybody tells me to my face to just forget her
That I should know my place and keep in line
But there's something deep inside of me
that tells me better
I'll make her mine 
I'll make her mine 
I'll make her mine
Around the corner and down the street
There is an angel oh I've got to meet
Soon she'll be making my life complete
Go there I must for love is just
around the corner The beginning the beginning of time
Rivers keep rolling
They run to the sea
Since the beginning of time
The birds that keep on aflying
Where no man can be
Since the beginning of time
Oh my darling let me tell you now
Long ago and far away
With just a hand full of faith
In seven days in seven nights
He built the world that we live in today
And so it was written
You were made for me
Since the beginning of time
And I just wonder do I have time enough to say
I just want to say that I
I thank the heaven above for making me
My destiny my love
Hmmm and you're mine
Baby you're mine
I wonder have I told you you're mine
Baby I said you're mine
Let me tell you
Ah said since the beginning of time Sunday is gloomy
My hours are slumberless
Dearest the shadows
I live without numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thoughts of ever returning you
Would they be angry
If I thought of joining you
Gloomy Sunday 
Sunday is gloomy
With shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon they'll be candles and prayers that are said I know
Let them not weep let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you
Gloomy Sunday
Dreaming I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you asleep
In the deep of my heart dear
Darling I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted youI'm here you're there
I'm here here's your share
Take your share
I'm here you're there
I'm here here's your share
Take your share
Just in case just in case
When I say I
I mean many I mean many
When I say I
I mean many I mean many
Just in case just in case

HopefullyMarianne was a good girl
The daughter of Professor Jones
One fateful day during a walk through the jungle
She fell into the catacombes
Now it's dark and damp
And she's without a lamp
Will the Professor hear his daughter's cry
Little does he know she's fallen into the pit
Of the beast with sixteen eyes

Professor Jones
He did not know
Professor Jones
He did not know
Where was his daughter
Where did she go
She's fallen to the beast of the webby hole
Tarantula 
With giant fangs
And eight hairy legs
The monster lives in an underground maze
Beneath the carpet of the Amazon jungle
It lies and waits for helpless prey
Now Professor Jones
Knew the legend of the monster
He found the mouth of the webby hole
Armed to the teeth he ventured forth
If he'd live or die he did not know
Night falls and I'm taken by sleep
Hot air blows up balloons in my dreams
Dingdong rings the bell
Something's at the door
So I put on my slippers
And I creep across the floor
For the door from hence I heard
Another ding dong
I peep through the door hole
But something's very wrong
As on my porch
There are thousands of snakes
Ready to strike
I feel queasy and
My knees start to shake
My perilous fate
I see no escape as serpents lay seige
To my country estate
The Devil must have opened up hell's gates
and called up millions of snakes
To take me from this place
Big ones Little ones
Fat ones Skinny ones
Protect me from their venomous drug
That springs from the needles of fangs
Attacked by Snakes
By Snakes
So many snakes
You could fill the grate lakes
With snakes
Ha ha ha run
I try to hide
But snake bites on my face testify
I've been attacked by snakes
By snakes so many snakes
It would take a thousand crates
To contain the snakes after me
I'd rather be burned at the stake
Than be attacked by snakes
Welcome to my world
Or should I say this land of snakes
Serpents lie and wait
At every take my knees quake
As my life these snakes invade
Snake invaders show their fangs
On the snake parade
My perilous fate
I see no escape
As my family prays and waits
I fight them off with
Shovels and rakes and
Bats and bones
But I just can't seem
To shake these foes
That slither from the dark
To destroy my home

One snake Two snake
Are there any more
There's two more
Knocking at my doorWell have you seen us
We summon awesome forces
We are the ones that myths and legends talk about
We're so far beyond your definitions
We cannot die we will not be broken
We have been chosen the lone protectors
To rescue those who can't survive
The onslaught of those Trojan horses
We cannot die we will not be broken
No no no
No way
No no no
Listen up kids
So many years so many broken mirrors
And yet the truth remains so clear
If you do not like us you might have to fight us
We cannot die no way
We are your average ordinary superhuman
Punishers of evil rock and roll band
And we've been designated to save this crazy world
We cannot die for this is our destiny
Come on now
Here we are now five lone men
Standing on the edge of disaster
Holding the sword of justice
And watch the hammer fall on all those who oppose us
For we are they and they are we the Aquabats
We cannot die no way
We are your average ordinary superhuman
Punishers of evil rock and roll band
And we've been designated to save this crazy world
And we must win for this is our destiny
This is our destiny
This is our destinyI got me a job and now I wonder if it's worth it
So clap your hands if you work for the man
Dlipping mopping cooking in the burger hut kickin'
Skin all shiny from the grease up in the kitchen
And why do the managers talk to me
Like I really care about a fast food career
And why do the other kids work here too
Try to get me all fired like I even want to work here
You make cheeseburgers pal
I can't take it
I just can't take it
I can't take it
I just can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it no more
I can't stand these cheeseburger politics
So I try to chat it up with somebody here
About anything besides this burger career
But everybody's grippin'
Moppin' so no slippin'
No one wants to get caught by someone else trippin'
And why do the people here all make a fuss
Of throwing other coworkers under the bus
And why don't they see you don't get paid that much more
Playing office politics like I even want to work here
You make cheeseburgers pal
We can't take it anymore
We don't want to fight in your burger war
We don't want to do this anymore
We don't want to fight in your burger war
No moreFunny faces
In sunny places
Being in love it feels so great
And all I need is
Two ingredients
My buttercup
And the perfect place
Me and you
Here's what we'll do
Walk handinhand
Into Lovers Land aah

In slow motion

It's real great
We're lovers of loving love
Lovers of loving love
It's so hip
To give you a kiss
And taste cherry chapstick aaah
It's our secret
Our little secret
We'll never tell
Don't talk
just watch the world go by
As we float away
In slow motion
So special
It's so special
You the girl I see
I am your boy to be

That I'm a boy and you're a girl alright
I'm so happy

Waiting in my metal fortress of sound
Lets get it on
But its all ready now
robot gorilla's how
A million pounds of steel
Fuzzy dice and steering wheel
Woah I know a way to make an escape
And get away
Woah
there can be no mistake
About the greatest ape of all
One man stands as the lone magician
Sending in plays to the ape transmission now
who can face
Who can face
Who can face the unbelievable
Mechanical Ape
Who can face
Who can face
Who can face the unbelievable Mechanical Ape
And I say woah
ohohoh
Woahohohoh 
Woahohohoh 
You cannot deface the
Mechanical Ape
Woahohohoh
So flip a switch turn it on
Make it run through all the fire and guns
And make it punch some wha
We will fight our way out
Monkey bit our way out
Point the mouse render
And never surrender
Wwwway to go
NnnNot too slow
Get up get up get
Lets go
Get up Get up get
Lets go
Oh oh oh ohWell it got my goat
For heaven's sake
What AHa
See something's come over
The people around here
They never leave their comfor zone
What Aha
They seem not to care
So try to steer clear
As the legend goes
Of the mystery house
The old man in his basement chained
A monster in the cabinet
A creature of habit
incredibly inevitable
Incredibly strange
Ever since the day
Just like a parade
When the old man moved to town
The people started losing track
Of important things they'd known
And folks 'round here lost the will
To get things done at all
Ask someone what wwent wrong
They'll say it's not their fault
So when you're feeling might low
Not just a little but a lot
You realize you're all messed up
But don't feel bad
A voice inside your head says
It's not your fault
The Thing
That climbs into your head at night
The Thing
With selfish teeth and greedy eyes
The Thing
That helps you escape your mistake
The Thing
There's something else that you can blame
THE THING IN THE BASS AMP
He unleashed the beast on the people
When it hit no one cried or screamed
They all went about their business
Getting back to the front of the TV screen
Now the thing he's part of your
He'll keep your pride alive
And who are they to accuse you
I guess they think that thing's a lie
It's a lie
It's a lie
It's a lie
It's a lie
So when you're feeling might low
Not just a little but a lot
You realize you're all messed up
But don't feel bad
A voice inside your head says
It's not your fault
The Thing
That climbs into your head at night
The Thing
With selfish teeth and greedy eyes
The Thing
That helps you escape your mistake
The Thing
There's something else that you can blame
It's alive
It's alive
It's a lieNew places and new faces
Can be so terrifying
When you're seperated
From your team
And in Space Mountain Land
ToddOne he's alone
He's crossed the danger line
Can he communicate
The location of the Secret Base
Trapped inSpace Mountain Land
ToddOne come in
ToddOne come in
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
ToddOne come in
He will think of she in
Hopes he can escape
Against the Science Man
Outnumbered five hundred to
ToddOne
He's got a chance
His uniform he converts
By removing sleeves in disguise
You can know his name
ToddOne trapped in Space Mountain LandThere is a girl she is brand new
So shiny vinyly
so finally we know what to do
And she is toxic what I hear
And just like plasticine
I want to squish her
Because she's perfect
She's plastic
She's perfectly plastic
Everybody wants to kiss her
Perfect plastic lips
They said to get away
But I can't give her the slip
It makes me wonder if this world is plastic
Awoahwoah you're really artificial
It makes me wonder if you might think
That I may be artificial myself
It makes me wonder if this world is plastic
Awoahwoah you're really artificial
It's officially official
You know that girl she's out of touch
So squeaky freaky and I'm thinking
That she may be too much
And she's a genius did you know
And yeah I'm sure she really cares about you
It's officially official
Kiss those plastic lipsWhen I was a boy I used to live in corduroy
OP shirts and slipon Vans
My life was so simple
I had not one pimple
My everyday was made up of these plans
To ride my bike to Thrifty's
Run past the balls and ice cream and
find the Star Wars figurines
Thinking of my action men
KungFu grip and all
What happened to them all

Running through my old life
Looking for my lost toys
Where has all my fun gone
Now that I'm much older
Before we get much colder
We'll get together and sing this song
An anthem for all lost toys
Now that we're all big boys
We'll get together and sing this song
We'll sing this song
It's not too long
So come along
So everybody sing along
When I was a little man
Playdough came in a little can
I was Star Wars' biggest fan
Now I'm stuck without a plan
GI Joe was an action man
Shaggy drove the mystery van
Devo was my favorite band
So take me back to my happy land
Now my brothers and sisters
I don't mean to make a scene
But I lost my action figures
and it makes me want to scream
Greedo Chewbacca Luke R2 and Han
3PO Yoda Bobafett Obi Wan
Green Machine Suckerman
Silly Putty Lincoln Logs
Sitting in my Underoos
Reading christmas catalogs
What happened to my action men and all
What happened to it all
Running through my old life
Looking for my lost toys
Where has all my fun gone
Now that I'm much older
Before we get much colder
We'll get together and sing this song
An anthem for all lost toys
Now that we're all big boys
We'll get together and sing this song
Are you ready 
Well okay
When I was a little man
Playdough came in a little can
I was Star Wars' biggest fan
Now I'm stuck without a plan
GI Joe was an action man
Shaggy drove the mystery van
Devo was my favorite band
Take me back to my happy land
Take me back to my happy land
Take me back to my happy land
Take me back to my happy land
Take me back to my happy land
I know that things are getting tougher
When you cant get top off from the bottom of the barrel
Wide open road of my future now
Its looking fucking narrow
All I know is that I dont know nothing
We get told to decide
Just like as if im not gonna change my mind
All I know is that I dont know nothing
Whatcha gonna do with yourself
Boy better make up your mind
Whatcha gonna do with yourself boy
You're running out of time
This time I got it all figured out
All I know is that I dont know nothing
And thats fineTake on the ocean
Where we belong
Like islands in the sun
I'll stick around
To be your hero your tugboat captain
We could swim out to the end
We can find our place to hide
We can slide across the sea and finally be free
In this space wide open
Take my hand to know
That I will never let you go
You are my joy my pride that keeps my heart alive
If we fall we won't cry
In these water mountains we can hide
There we can close our eyes
And we can be all right
We can write this story
Raise our arms in glory
As we step off the world to slide
 Waterslide

We can slide

Waterslide
We'll slide across the sea
We're drawing lines on the water
You take a swim with Neptune's daughter
You want to splash in the sea green planet
And let the world go
Just let the birds go birds go
We'll don't waste another breath
Make sure you take time
To pass along imagination
Before you're gone
And your life slips away
So write this story with meScience brings gifts of convenience
To the modern man
Modern man then continues
Continues to expand
But what happens when man creates
Something oh so wrong
Nature bites back in a big way
Good heavens what have I done

I kept it in a box
I watched it grow a lot
It chewed right through the lock
And ate all the new kids on the block
A scientist creates a beast
In a secret laboratory
Nature plots revenge
It's blood that it seeks
That's where we begin our story

The Cat with 2 Heads
Whoa the Cat with 2 Heads 
College brought education
To this privileged man
High school diploma
A science major
with a government grant
Four years later an experiment
To mutate domestic pets
It turned into a nightmare
So lock your doors
Hide your hot dogs
This cat's upset

Society's been so good to me
My parents paid for my college education
Majoring in biotechnology
Created a beast and now it's after me

Two heads of terrorStuck together you and me
Always together honey and bees
Forever and ever can you see
We were meant to be
But you tried to leave
Stuck together
It was easy to do
Always together
New and improved
Together forever
With hands of glue
The kind of glue that you can't remove
My arms are good
But my hands are bad
I just want to stick them to your head
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Being alone is not for me
Not in America the land of the free
Stuck together we'll always be
Ronald Reagan can you help me
Oh no no one understands
Oh no why there's glue on my hands
Oh no come on over here
Oh no can't you see there's nothing to fear
Stuck together
You won't escape
Always together
It's too late
Forever and ever
Accept your fate
Because my hands
Are stuck to your face
My arms are good
But my hands are bad
I'm a little bit crazy a little bit mad
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
My arms are good
But my hands are bad
I just want to stick them to your head
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Being alone is not for me
Not in America the land of the free
Stuck together we'll always be
Ronald Reagan can you help me
Oh no no one understands
Oh no why there's glue on my hands
Oh no come on over here
Oh no can't you see there's nothing to fear
Oh dear oh dear ha haaaI put my head down on my desk
To help me get through all this mess
I fell asleep and before I was done
I woke up in shock my whole arm was numb
I woke up in shock my whole arm was numb
I woke up in shock my whole arm was numb
I woke up in shock 
I fell asleep on my arm
And now it's totally numb
I fell asleep on my arm
My shoulder's just a big limp stump
I fell asleep on my arm
My arm's like a big limp stump
The bell rang class dismissed
I'm sitting here a little bit dissed
I stepped to the door
But I can't leave
I can't feel the doorknob my arm's asleep

Who's gonna carry my books

What if I have to pee

My arm's like a big limp stump

And now it's totally numb
I fell asleep on my arm
My arm's like a big limp stump
Corporate America makes pencils
For the man with the left hand
They make pencils for the man with the right hand
But what about the man with the numb hand
Four hundred grand to see The Rage
From back here I can't see the stage
It's time to start my own parade
So lift up your arm and wave
I fell asleep on my arm
And now it's totally numb

My shoulder's just a big limp stump
I fell asleep on my arm
My arm's like a big limp stump
I feel no pain
In my arm
I feel no pain
In my arm
When's it gonna change
It feels so strange
It's just one of those days
In my arm
I'm gonna slam it in the door
I'm gonna wiggle it around
'Cause I feel no pain
In my arm
It feels so strange
It's just one of those days
Boom da bop da boom ba diggy diggyEveryday when I get in my car

Make sure you know where it goes
Not in your nose

 What
 Who IS Danger Woman
If you've seen it once you'll see it again
I told everyone and all of my friends
Well there she is and she's at it again
And I think it's all over and now

She's hanging off the chopper
And no one's gonna stop her
Don't try and call the doctor
'Cause she's jumpin' around now
Handle bar standing
And flying over canyons
No hands on the landing
Now we're rollin' around on the ground
If you could just believe what you can not see
Well that may be she may as well be
Well there she is and she's at it again
And I think it's all over and now

She's hanging off the chopper
And nothing's gonna stop her
Don't even call the doctor
'Cause she's jumpin' around now
Handle bar standing
And flying over canyons
No hands on the landing
Now we're rollin' around on the ground



Woah she's flying around in her head

Woah Punishing what's left of the WWF
If that's what you want

You want Danger Woman

At the Kareoke showdown
Don't try to understand her
The Phantom Highlander
The Songbird Avenger
It's Danger WomanMr Bonkers in the shade
Under a rock he starts his day
Not moving much with
Not too much to say
Mr Bonkers leads a simple life
No motor car no house no wife
It's cold he thinks
As he washes up in the sink
While the spiders go bananas
He slips into his new pajamas
And waits to be king
Mr Bonkers the silent one
Thinks of times when he was young
He could run so fast
He could win the prize
He tried and tried
To dial correctly
But the President's number's
Not listed in the directory
Directory
Directory
Look inside the door
You'll never hear him snore
Not a lot to do
But sit and stare at you
Something you should know
Before you say Hello
Motionless like lead
He sits he must be dead
But wait He's's alive
He's alive He's alive
Chomping on the bits
Of crickets in his mitts
In the dark he's lost
Oh my gosh it's lost
In black light he's great
His legs they number eight
He must have got his paws
From his Grandpapa
Holding Crushing bait
Under pincers weight
But the one thing unforgetable
Don't forget the mandible  
No probascis here
It's Mr Bonkers' year
He's sick sick sick
With the bicycle kick
You can't see his eyes or ears
Woah yeah yeah
Woah yeah yeah
Can you see him tonight
Woah yeah yeah
Woah yeah yeah
Under the hot rock light
Woah yeah yeah
Woah yeah yeah
Can you see him tonight
Woah yeah yeah
Woah yeah yeah
Under the hot rock light
Woah yeah yeah
Woah yeah yeah
Woah yeah yeah
Woah yeah yeah
Woah yeah yeah
Woah yeah yeahDrop me off right here
I can go no further
It seems life's too hard for you
How come I feel like hanging around to win
When it seems you always lose
When you're stuck in the middle
With rejections again
It's time to call your reject friends
And meet me at the bottom of the wishing well range
And talk about an hour of change
And it seems so bad
Yeah it so bad
Can we rescue ourselves from the former lives we had
Is it too late
Is it game over
Will it get better
It's better or will it
'Cause
Willy don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
He lost it on the Fourth of July
He don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
Things will never be the same 'cause
Willy's on his way
Don't throw sparklers or shoot them through the air
'Cause you never know when it's coming down
Breathtaking Soccer
Can be such a shocker
So try to get away somehow
When all you got is your bike
But Bike Rides are dumb
You gotta take a look inside
And find the secrets to life
Are down at the bottom
Of the underground waterslide
And it seems so bad
Yeah it so bad
Can we rescue ourselves from the former lives we had
Is it too late
Is it game over
Will it get better
It's better or will it
'Cause
Willy don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
He lost it on the Fourth of July

Willy don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
Things will never be the same 'cause
Willy's on his way
Can we remember what we've got
Before we open our big mouths
To complain about the things we cannot change
Instead of always asking why
At least you've got your two good eyes
We could try to find our zone
Or just sit and cry alone
Willy don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
He lost it on the Fourth of July
Now he don't got an eye
So don't cry
Baby
Run
Hunt
Kill
Man in his base nature
Searching for food
A quest for fire
He sharpens his spear
The time has passed
And man has changed
Why am I here
These mortal chains
Of animal strains
Causing this man to fear

Raised me hands

I bake the cake
Make no mistake I like to bake
Once I discover
My innate behavior
To mix to make to bake
Up in the morning
To start my work
I cannot help wanting to bake a dessert
Like a gladiator
About to meet his fate
I enter my arena bow my head and start to bake
You want a cookie
Or Baked Alaska
Truly the opus of bakers everywhere
Flour Sugar Milk
I send out for more
An unsung hero I need no reward
A short vacation I'd like to take
After I bake a chocolate cake
Sometimes It's mighty lonely
When you're all alone

But I'm just doing my job
The best that I can
So the children can be fed

I am the Baker

I bake the cake

Make no mistake I like to bake

Once I discover

My innate behavior

To mix to make to bake


I am the Baker

I bake the cake

You're the decorator and you decorate

You take the credit

While I slave away

And if you want adventure
It's the place to be
The sea wolves and the giant squids
Are coming up from The Wild Sea
And here's where I'll stay
For ten years and a day
We're on a quest to find hidden treasure
And mystery on The Wild Sea
Now the Sun she's shining for everyone

Now we're taking on water
In the Dead Dog's Galley
A man overboard everyday
Captured by pirates
In the isle of donuts
Rescued by some maidens
Who then ran away
And here's where we'll be
We never know what we'll see
We can battle ghosts
On the bottom of the ocean
Or ride the waves
Of The Wild Sea
Now the Sun she's shining for everyone
But we'll set sail and we'll be gone
We're sailing on
We're sailing on
Sailing on and on and on and on

The SeaGhost in the Isle of Dread
Pirates on the sea  pirates that no man can name

Beware of the Ska Robot ArmyHey big fella
I see you're outta jail
You got a brand new hat
You're walking big
You're walking tall
With your brand new baseball bat
You've got your beeper
You've got your gun
And a whole bunch of cool tattoos
Start fights at the pits at all the shows
So everybody will look at you
You're ignorant
It's knowledge you lack
You gotta fight everything you can
A big puffy head
You're the Marshmallow Man
Straight outta Compton
Is your battle cry
But you're from a suburban track
Didn't your mom and daddy teach you
That ghetto stuff is really whack
What happened to the little puffyheaded boy
We all once knew
Marshmallow man you better watch yourself
Before someone steps on you
Check yourself before
You wreck yourself
A little man with a gun in his hand
You're such a fool
Big marshmallow manI saw you there
with your pretty blondeish hair
eating a breakfast burrito
you seemed so neato
so we took the bus down to the pier
Down on the sand
by the metal detector man
we looked across the bay
as the dolphins swam away
we held hands
and just imagined
with tears in my eyes
you had to say goodbye
you had to go
you couldn't tell me why
you said something about you moving to Alaska
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you so much
Those hot summer nights
won't last forever
I know you're gone and you can't come home
I'm so alone but I'll never forget about you
I understand
So I bought a krugerrand
I'll wear you near my heart
We'll never be apart
Now the heavens will smile upon us
With tears in my eyes
you had to say goodbye
you had to go
You couldn't tell me why
You said something about you moving living on an iceberg
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you so much
Those hot summer nights
Won't last foreverLook at you
And if I wanted to
I could see someone in there
Who'd like to be the happiest clam on the beach
But look at you
You're the Angry Clown
Trying to push all the kids around
But there's a flying horse that could change that course
Hey Hey Hey
Hey Luno
Hey Hey Hey
Hey Luno
Can he stop the enemy
We only believe in what we see
But he can do it you never know
But we don't know
Hey Hey Hey
Hey Luno
Hey Hey Hey
Hey Luno
Why can't you just call his name
Then Luno could come down
And take you far away to the land of the same
Then you'll see how fun it is
That flying horse is true
And you're stuck in a world with people just as sad as you
Can he stop the enemy
We only believe in what we see
But he can do it you never know
But we don't know
Just call his name
And he will come
The Flying Horse
Luno
Hey Hey Hey
Hey LunoI stumbled into Obakemon
He said my name in Japanese
He took me through the portal 
I did not want to go
It seemed a celebration
Was prepared to meet me there
This is the place of no return
I want to go back
There she comes now in veil
She's walking doen the aisle
So close now she winks
I recognize that smile
A spider and I
A fly with whitegloved hands
Wait Something's a miss
But this wedding has been planned
A man with no head in the chamber
Handed me the ring
Then the creeps and the freaks
Clapped in joyous agony
Did they ask if I take this thing to be my wife
It came down to the second in the land of the final frontier
There she comes now in veil
She's walking doen the aisle
So close now she winks
I recognize that smile
A spider and I
A fly with whitegloved hands
Wait Something's a miss
But this wedding has been plannedMommy

Where does dirt come from
Dirt comes from The Worms
Wow Awesome
There is a chipmunk
At the center of the earth
And in his big oven
He bakes his own desserts
He warms the ocean
And from that life springs forth
Little organisms building trash around the clock
Compost heaps
Or melting pots
For Farmer John's
Smoked Sausage stocks
Worms make the dirt
And the dirt makes the earth
And all of the roots have a place to sleep now
All the chanuks have squash to eat now
Worms make the dirt
And the dirt makes the earth
And people hold hands and feel terrific
Food comes from dirt
It's scientific
Yeah Wow
There's so much to learn
The Sun came from a cave
And it made the clouds go by

The clouds had a conference
And rain fell from the sky

Worms got thirsty
From eating too much dirt

They came up through the ground
And got eaten by the birds

Some worms escaped
With their lives

They excreted soil
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Worms make the dirt
And the dirt makes the earth
And all of the roots have a place to sleep now
All the chanuks have squash to eat now
Worms make the dirt
And the dirt makes the earth
And people hold hands and feel terrific
Food comes from dirt
It's scientific
THE MIRACLE OF LIFE IS AWESOME
AWESOME

To sing along

Woah Woah
I don't know what to do
Woah Woah
It's such a waste you know
I'm sorry baby but I've got to go

It's time to say goodbye
It's been real fun
I've got to run
I'll be real busy but
Maybe I'll call you later
Can I be honest with you

You're such a beautiful girl

Latrine policeDeep in the mountains
Beyond the jungle
Lies a secret cave
Where the tigers roam
There is a rider
The thunderbringer
He waits upon his throne
Until he's ready to ride
Woah
He rides
Ride the tiger
The supervillian
He's so cartoonish
His fiendish plots and plans
Have been put to action
He is Time Sprinkler
Defrigerated
He's launched an army of creeps
And now the rider must ride
Woah
He rides
Ride the tiger

It's kinda' new not very old
About a female martian with a wild grin
Big orange eyes and green skin
Blue was her hair
She came from way up there
She wore silver underwear
Almost naked but she didn't care
Why oh why did she come from
Planet V
I don't know woh who who

Martian girl from Planet V
Will you marry me
Wo wo wo wo wo
She came from outer space
She came to see
If earth was good
Wo wo wo wo
In the supermarket she got distracted
In the meat department
Wo wo wo wo wo
She's looking at me
She's looking hungry
Think she's gonna eat me
Wo wo wo wo wo
She's not a bird
She's not a plane
She's got green blood
Pumping through her veins
Saw a light in the sky
And then I found her
Now I'm having my own close encounter
She smiled at me as she fixed her hair
And then she kissed me
Right then and there
I started bleeding
That's the weirdest part
''cause this alien's teeth were razor sharp

Woah Oh Baby
What a wacky alien she was
I'll tell you why It's just because
She had an appetite that couldn't be beat
She came from space to eat people meat
I guess I didn't taste good anyway
''cause when she kissed me
she flew away
When I was a boy I used to live in corduroy
OP shirts and slipon Vans
My life was so simple
I had not one pimple
My everyday was made up of these plans
To ride my bike to Thrifty's
Run past the balls and ice cream and
find the Star Wars figurines
Thinking of my action men
KungFu grip and all
What happened to them all

Running through my old life
Looking for my lost toys
Where has all my fun gone
Now that we're all older
Before we grow much colder
Let's all look forward to the new dawn
An anthem for all lost toys
Now that we're all big boys
We'll stand together and sing this song
We'll sing this song
It's not too long
So everybody sing along
When I was a little man
Playdough came in a little can
I was Star Wars' biggest fan
Now I'm stuck without a plan
GI Joe was an action man
Shaggy drove the mystery van
Devo was my favorite band
Take me back to my happy land
Now my brothers and sisters
I don't mean to make a scene
But I lost my action figures
and it makes me want to scream
Greedo Chewbacca Luke R2 and Han
3PO Yoda Bobafett Obi Wan
Green Machine Suckerman
Silly Putty Lincoln Logs
Sitting in my Underoos
Reading christmas catalogs
What happened to my action men and all
What happened to it all
Running through my old life
Looking for my lost toys
Where has all my fun gone
Now that we're all older
Before we grow much colder
Let's all look forward to the new dawn
An anthem for all lost toys
Now that we're all big boys
We'll stand together and sing this song
We'll sing this song
It's not too long
So everybody sing along
When I was a little man
Playdough came in a little can
I was Star Wars' biggest fan
Now I'm stuck without a plan
GI Joe was an action man
Shaggy drove the mystery van
Devo was my favorite band
Take me back to my happy land
Take me back to my happy land
Take me back to my happy land
Take me back to my happy land
Take me back to my happy landNow now now
I'm just a boy
I watch too much TV
Nobody knows nobody knows
Casper the Ghost is so friendly
Nobody knows nobody knows
Sitting in my living room
With nothing else to do
I think I'm going blind
Just like Mr Magoo
I know every single ending
Of every Scooby Doo
Now

Turn off the idiot box
It's a disease just like the Chicken Pox
Turn off the idiot box
Now
Find yourself a partner
Turn on the television
And let it control your mind
Friends Romans countrymen
I've got something to say
Nobody knows nobody knows
Get up off the couch
Get up go out and play
Nobody knows Nobody knows

Children I want to warn 'ya
''cause I've been to California
Where Mickey Mouse is a demon
Turn it off If you are able
Nobody knows nobody knows
Take a pair of scissors
And cut off that cable
Nobody knows Nobody knows
When time scrambles and it's gone away
Can you stop to start again
No time
No one will laugh will laugh when it strikes
This diabolic plan to break up all order
And who holds the key to stop
The countdown of the global secret combination
These heroes changing
Recognize we've been so undermined
Danger walking blind
But those hands on the clock
Give no room no thought
No words
No mind
No age
Sequence erased
NO TIME
Prolong the wait with hopeless information
Time and space erased no indication
Knife in the back I stagger to the phone
Who can I call I'm now complete aloneI was at the supermarket
Watching people cut in line
I started thinking about human nature
What would you do
if there was no more food
My mind began to wander
About greed and hunger
And just how many other countries
Are getting ready for another war
But the sun was shining
And everything seemed fine
So count me in
I'll see you on the other side
Chemical bomb
Chemical bomb
Eyes melt Skin explodes
Everybody's dead
It won't be long
It won't be long
People gonna run around
Losing their heads
A river of blood
Who's gonna live
The earth is tired of human kind
And I think this world
Is gonna wash up in Hell
La la la la la
La la la la la
La lala la la la la
Then I had another vision
In the crowded grocery store
I saw the Pale Rider on his horse
Decapitating people in the parking lot
And all the shoppers were beasts
What could I do to hide
Back in this world of humankind
I think we've already lost our minds
But the sun was shining
And everything seemed fine
So count me in
I'll see you on the other side
Chemical bomb
Chemical bomb
Eyes melt Skin explodes
Everybody's dead
It won't be long
It won't be long
People gonna run around
Losing their heads
A river of blood
Who's gonna live
The earth is tired of human kind
And I think this world
Is gonna wash up in Hell
La la la la la
La la la la la
La lala la la la la
maybe maybe maybeThe bells are ringing

The Train's pulling out

Until the zero hour
Until the zeroWhere the mountains meet the sky
I met a very very very teeny guy
Little coat little pants
When he spoke to me
It made me dance
He said to me
You won't believe
So I wrote what he said on my sleeve
And if you listen
I will repeat
The words this tiny man did speak
One Two Three Four
Listen up now here we go

Well I could not understand what he spoke
I thought maybe it was some kind of joke
He laughed at me and before long
This tiny little man was gone
So I walked on and on my way
I met another tiny person that same day
She rode a velvet ant like an elephant
And as I listened I heard her say
Uno Dos Tres Four
Time to go again once more

It was somethin' weird
He had a little beard
He wore a rhino beetle
Bullfighter's coat
He had a part in his hair
Like a paper tear
And had a little tiny frog in his throat
What did it mean
I was all mixed up
And as I stumbled
And hit the ground
What a pity
I found the tiny people's city
And those teenies all made this sound

Pumping those weights like he's running out of time
Gotta bench those reps gotta burn that fat
He's got a flat top cut and a wicked ponytail in back
And a fanny pack Aah
Yeah he's Amino Man
Yeah with an oily tan
Yeah he's got to prove it to himself
He's changing into something
Yeah he's Amino Man
Yeah with the bottle tan
Yeah in the mirror he sees himself
Turning into something else
Now Amino man's got a problem with his size
2 part muscle 1 part goon
Chemicals help him cut back on the pain
But he got so big he ran out of skin to strain
He popped his brain
Yeah he's Amino Man
Yeah with an oily tan
Yeah he's got to prove it to himself
He's turning into something
Yeah he's Amino Man
Yeah with the bottle tan

Whoa yeah he was a lot like you
You better think about it baby
Woah yeah he was a lot like you
Now he's Amino ManScience brings gifts of convenience
To the modern man
Modern man then continues
Continues to expand
But what happens when man creates
Something oh so wrong
Nature bites back in a big way
Good heavens what have I done
I kept it in a box
I watched it grow a lot
It chewed right through the lock
And ate all the new kids on the block
A scientist creates a beast
In a secret laboratory
Nature plots revenge
It's blood it seeks
That's where we begin our story
The Cat with 2 Heads
Whoa the Cat with 2 Heads
The Cat with 2 Heads
Whoa the Cat with 2 Heads
College brought education
To this privileged man
High school diploma
A science major
with a government grant
Four years later an experiment
To mutate domestic pets
It turned into a nightmare
So lock your doors
Hide your hot dogs
This cat's upset
I kept it in a box
I watched it grow a lot
It chewed right through the lock
And ate all the new kids on the block
Society's been so good to me
My parents paid for my college education
Majoring in biotechnology
Created a beast and now it's after me
I was in my laboratory
Creating what I thought would be
Well
Something great for the World
A two headed cat
You could pet one kitty's head
Then pet the other kitty's head
But little did I know the power of Atomic Energy
Would create
A two headed
ManEating Monster
The Cat with 2 Heads
Whoa the Cat with 2 Heads
The Cat with 2 Heads
Whoa the Cat with 2 Heads
The Cat with 2 Heads
Whoa the Cat with 2 Heads
The Cat with 2 Heads
Whoa the Cat with 2 Heads
Two heads of terrorHere's something to think about
When things go wrong all the time
That luck can change like that high tide
Bad things can soon turn out alright
Misfortune a tradgedy
I can't seem to mind
Soon good will happen
If you look you just might find
So when you think this is the end
Good things are just around the bend
Again bad things are just a sign
Good things will happen in due time
And with each passing day
So goes another life
Everybody wants to live
Some people want to die
So close your eyes
'Cause it's alright to say
Hello Goodnight
Goodnight
So if this is to be our time
Just think of what we left behind
Will they say good of you to last
Or lose the memory of you fast
Forever and ever
A wonderful thing
Will someone be grateful
For what we tried to bring
It's late
But just remember then
This day will never come again
Everybody wants to live
Some people want to die
So close your eyes
'Cause it's alright to say
Hello Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight
Hello Goodnight    Dear Spike
I can tell that your company cares about its customers
And that's why I wrote this letter
To express my thanks to you in this endeavor
Today I got my stuff that I ordered long ago
And I wanted you to know that I also got the note
And now if you don't mind I'd like to take some time
I hope you understand this letter from a grateful fan
I had a dream a very strange dream
Where I was waiting for my package
Then up through the clouds
I saw this bus a flying bus
It was coming towards me
It hovered above I saw my order
Floating down and softly touched ground
Then I saw Spike he was flying the bus
He smiled and waved as the bus flew away
I just wanna let you know
How grateful I am to you
I appreciate all the hard work
And kindness you put into
Dear Spike
Dear Spike
What a task it must have been
Dear Spike
Dear Spike
I'm so glad to know you didn't forget me
I had a dream a very strange dream
Where I was waiting for my package
Then up through the clouds
I saw this bus a flying bus
It was coming towards me
It hovered above and I saw my order
Floating down and softly touched ground
Then I saw Spike he was flying the bus
He smiled and waved as the bus flew away
I just want to let you know
How thankful I am to you
I appreciate all the hard work
And kindness you put into
Dear Spike
Dear Spike
What a task it must have been
Dear Spike
Dear Spike
I'm so glad to know that you didn't forget me
You didn't forget me Spike

How thankful I am to you
I appreciate all the hard work
And kindness you put into
Dear Spike
Dear Spike
What a task it must have been
Dear Spike
Dear Spike
I'm so glad to know that you didn't forget about meWhos goin for distance
I loved a girl named Sandyface
She lived outside of town
In a tent made of diapers
In the sand she laid face down
She had a pillow of cactus
And her bed was desert land
I suppose the call her Sandyface
Because her face was covered in sand
And I remember her sandy face
And I remember her sandy smile
That Sandy was the apple
Of many bloodshot eyes
And one day she fell victim
To a sheep in wolf's disguise
They said a man with banana bread
And a beehive on his chin
Sold my love to the Grateful Dead
Stole her land and then cashed in
Yeah
There's a oneeyed dog
With horns like a yak
Wax lips and a broken back
His feet in front face the opposite
Of his hind legs in the back
He tried to save that sandy girl
From the city man disease
But was stung to death
By all the pets
Of the man with the beard of bees
Oh Sandyface
I do recall
Oh Sandyface
I could not do it all
Lets go
Up and down here we go come on

Dr Rock was on a jog
Saw my dear in the parking lot
Selling grilled cheese sandwiches
In hippy slavery
Dr Rock tried to free my love
But he had no gun
So he dialed me collect
On 1010321
I got the call from Dr Rock
Raced down to the scene
But Sandy had been swept away
Into the Rainbow Sea
Swim swim away
Oh Sandy
Swim so far away from him
Swim far away from this place
Just keep that sand on that face
But it was too late
I went back to that stinky place
Where I first met my Sandy but
Whitey and his beard of bees
Had built a Pizza Hut
So I bought a slice in memory
Poured sand on the cheese
And as I ate
Off that sandy plate
I missed my oneeyed dog
And now it's over
The tide has washed her face
And now it's
Oh Sandyface
I do recall
Oh Sandyface
I could not
Do it all
CD Repo Man
He can go where I can't go
CD Repo Man
He'll infiltrate your stereo
CD Repo Man
He'll sneak up around the back
CD Repo Man
He'll get your CDs back
Some people who seem to
Call themselves my friends
Take my CDs
Then they all pretend
That they lost my music
But I've got a plan
To find the nearest pay phone and
call the Repo Man

When CD Repo Man
That guy is on a roll
He'll jump through windows
To get back what the suckers stole
He looks tame but
You know he will attack
He does his job
To get your CDs back

When your possessions are gone
And something is wrong
There is action to take
Don't call him unless you're really ticked
Because there is no escape
He wears a suit it looks like he's strapped
Don't mess with him
Or you'll get smacked
Don't steal my CDs
That don't make no sense
Because a Repo Man is always intense
Hey
Found myself on the run again but my motorcycle crashed into a barbed wire fence
I could've sworn you were following me in a run away soviet submarine
I saw your face in the rearview mirror I turn around and your not there
Now I'm trapped in a building and I'm tied to the top
An I'm trying to make it out before the bomb goes off
I think I know its like id seen it all before
And I think I know
So please keep quiet don't spoil the ending
I'm stuck in a movie now
Feels like I'm stuck in a movie
I'm stuck in a movie now
Feels like I'm stuck in a movie
Coming after you and its getting dark
Your fumbling your keys and your car wont start
There's a kid down your back with giant crazy words
There's a kindly old wizard on the wings of a bird
I think I know its like id seen it all before
And I think I know
So please keep quiet don't spoil the ending
I'm stuck in a movie
Feels like I'm stuck in a movie
I'm stuck in a movie
Feels like I'm stuck in a movie
Is this a tragic end for me
Or will the sequel set me free
If you want to know if this is imitation or something real
If you want to be here in my feature film
Then take your plane and sail off
Oh oh oh oh o ohoh
I'm stuck in a movie now
Feels like I'm stuck in a movie
I'm stuck in a movie now
Feels like I'm stuck in a movieIn a bottle of noodles
I found a small green fish
Who told a fish story
He could grant me any wish
OK I said That sounds great
I think I understand
The fish rolled up his sleeves
And said Your wish is my command
I want a box of gold
And a palace of pearls
A nice big pool for my sadeyed girls
I want a car that can fly
And XRay eyes
I'd wish for more wishes
''cause it can't get better than this
So there it was that's it
I can quit my job
I've got better things to do all day
''cause in my spare time
I'm in a Rock n' Roll band
And in my full time
I just sit and wait
For my box of gold
And my palace of pearls
A nice big pool for my sadeyed girls
For the car that can fly
for my XRay eyes
I'd like more wishes
''cause it can't get better than this
I can do anything
''cause I'm wishing for everything
It could happen
it could happen
Will it be
You tell me
Does it get much better than this
When I woke up
I found the bottle was gone
Someone took it away
i guess I'll just have to wait
For my box of gold
And my palace of pearls
A nice big pool for my sadeyed girls
For the car that can fly
for my XRay eyes
I wish I had more wishes
''cause it didn't get better than this
I can do anything
''cause I'm wishing for everything
It could happen
it could happen
Will it be
You tell me
Does it get much better than thisYo I'm a freak I'm so unique

Playin' it cool And being discreet
It's not a mistake It's mystique
Now I see this other guy hanging around
the girl I like but
She'll never like him he ain't playin' it
cool
and they're holding hands but this guy
don't understand that
he's better off playin' it cool like me
Hand back playin' it cool
She's thinking I'm mysterious
because I haven't said a word to her
not even once
I look away when she smiles at me and
soon she will see
that I'm playin' it cool and that she
really likes me
Chorus
Today's gonna' be the best day of my
life so far
Today's gonna' be the best day of my
life so far
I've no particular reason why I think
today's gonna be so nice
But today's gonna' be the best day of my
life so far
No it's not my birthday or the end of
school
and I didn't win the lottery or anything
That cool
I didn't get a trophy for something great
I've done
but I say today's gonna be so great it's
only just because
Just because I feel like having the best
day I can
and if you don't like it then I guess
that's your problem

Why do I need a reasong to have an
awesome day
For me it's enough when I wake up and look around and say
Hey Today's gonna be the best day that
I have ever had
And I'm not quite sure if it's going to work
but I'll try the best I can
Just because I feel like having the best
day I can
and if you don't like it then I guess
that's your problem

And if I fail to have the best day that I
can
then I'll wait for tomorrow and try it
once again
And again and again and again and again
Again Again Again Again Again

I've been left in a ditch
I never made the cut so to speak
I never even got to warm the bench
But with you I know when that whistle blows
You keep me rockin' you keep me rockin' baby
When I'm out on the job site
I'm thinkin' that we're gonna be alright
Be alright
Four radios blastin' classic rock
And they're pointing at you
With your fist raised high
and a hitch in your step
You've got it all
I've got no reason to lie
Look at me look at me look at me I'm a winner

It's just as simple as that
Don't you agree don't you agree don't you agree that I'm a winner

You just can't argue with that
Someone once told me
You can't lose em' all
And that someone was you
But when I nail gunned my hand to the wall
I started to wonder if that could be true
But babe it's me you chose
And when the whistle blows
You keep me rockin' keep me rockin' baby
And when I'm out on the job site
I'm thinkin' we're gonna be alright

You just can't argue with thatI had a small friend who had a fat friend who had a big friend who
gave birth to many friends with our flashlights
to the sky we waited for them to land I got two tall friends who know
my small friend who seems to have a
problem with you They got roman candles bottle rockets for the vandals
who covered our lockers in glue
We're on our way here we go we're gonna take over Se it off one last
time he're we come again
We were strangers and we were pilgrims role models of the family man
Pioneers  patriarchs patriots *
matriarchs staking out the promised land Our little army  we were
commandos guerrillas with decoder rings We
felt opposition from some villains who were wishing they could be cadets
and kings
We're on our way here we go we're gonna take over Se it off one last

Why won't they climb away Because other
lobsters pull them down
Cherry pits and paper clips and people talking smack Giant squid will
come right up and pull your train right off
the track
Mammoth broom swoops on down and sweeps you in a whole
Friends help each other any way they can When you're up at bat they'll
be your biggest fan When you're in a pit
they'll pull you out of it It ain't wrong to write a song for all your
friends to sing along
People too me and you can also be like LOBSTERS in BUCKETS It's all
just one big mess Please don't be a
LOBSTER friends are best
Making lunch for the baseball bunch while playing violin Feeding bands
to giant clams that's where the fun
begins cantaloupes and cowboy ropes hone those whittleing skills
Friends help each other any way they can When you're up at bat they'll
be your biggest fan When you're in a pit
they'll pull you out of it It ain't wrong to write a song for all your
friends to sing alongWell I remember my first day of public school
I was very scared of getting pummeled
And sure enough i did at first recess
I got pegged in the head by a big red ball
And stumbled my head hung
Back to class with a bloody nose
and soon it was lunch time
Mom said I should ask about how poor kids there get fed
So i got a book of tickets and a scedule and it read

Monday hotdogs
Tuesday Tacos
Wednesday hamburgers and chocolate milk
Thursday sloppy joes and burritos in a bag
Friday was pizza day the best day of the week
All the kids would line up super early just to eat
Monday hotdogs
Tuesday Tacos
Wednesday hamburgers and chocolate milk
Thursday sloppy joes and burritos in a bag
Friday was pizza day the best day of the week
It always came with salad and a side of pork and beans
Hooray for pizza day
Hooray for pizza day
I miss pizza day
The best day of the week
Well i remember my first day of Jr High
I had hairspray in my hair and my pants were way too tight
And all the breakers and newwavers and the rockers and the preps
Would all be in their places on the front lawn or the steps
I hung out with some punker kids who used to make me laugh
Got thrown in the dumpster by some rich kids near the caff
As time went on we figured out it was totally uncool
To eat the welfare lunch
Provided by the school
So in poser punker fashion we just mooched off all the kids
And lived off eating candy bars and bags of nacho chips

Well now I'm out of school and i don't have a job 
I just sit around all sweaty and lethargic
And i'm just thinkin' 'bout where it all went wrong
Why I can't concentrate on anything but reruns
I wish i had some more stability and I
I wish I had somebody makin' lunch for me
I guess I miss the simple things in life
The thought of pizza day
I thought it stupid then but I wish I had it now
I just want

Hooray for pizza day
Hooray for pizza day
I miss pizza day
Best day of the week
Says Michael Jackson of Ensino California
When he's not in his little theme parks
He's eating pizza with the kids
Whoa moonwalker's back
Hey grab a slice buddy
Take your glove off first
You'llenjoy it moreThe radiation in the ground
Makes a lovely bubbly sound
The men in suits
Who don't eat fruit
Can't comprehend
The onelegged newt
That was caused from disaster
At reactor's core
A meltdown expected
To start a war
Now I bought myself
A lead ascot
It looks good but
I'm startin' to rot
Hey you
With that green glow in your hair
I swear I see a tear
In your radiation wear
Somehow it's there
Razorblade boomerangs
And iron hands
Crossbows and hockey pads
Are in demand
Toxic waste
In synthetic place
Can add an eyeball
To your face
Hey you
With that green glow in your hair
I swear I see a tear
In your radiation wear
Somehow it's there
Hey me
You know your gums
Are starting to bleed
I've got some shrinktofit
Mutated genes
And some bleak posterity
If they end up like me
I am Humongous
Everybody knows I own the wasteland
And now may I introduce to you
Benji The Tapdancing Mutant boy
Hi I'm Benji
I'm a tapdancing mutant
I wasn't always like this
I was born a normal boy
But now I live in this world of joy
It's Benji from Peoria
Don't drink the water
I implore ya
But his mom and dad
They were exposed
And that's how the neutrons grow
Hey you
With that green glow in your hair
I swear I see a tear
In your radiation wear
Somehow it's there
Hey me
You know your gums
Are starting to bleed
I've got some shrinktofit
Mutated genes
And some bleak posterity
If they end up like me
Just walk away
Just walk away
There's been too much violence
Just walk awayThe wind blows and I see dust A cloud of white upon the horizon My
pallet knows this is a bust breakfast is

Cat with 2 Heads
Science brings gifts of convenience to the modern man Modern man then
continues continues to expand but
what happens when man creates something oh so wrong Nature bites back
in a big way good heavens what have
I done
I kept it in a box I watched it grow a lot It chewed right through the
lock and ate all the new kids on the block
A scientist creates a beast in a secret laboratory Nature plots
revenge it's blood that it seeks that's where we
begin our story
The Cat with 2 Heads Whoa the Cat with 2 Heads
College brough education to this privileged man High school diploma
science major with a government grant
four years later an experiment to mutate domestic pets It turned into
a nightmare so lock your doors  hide your
hot dogs this cat's upset
I kept it in a box I watched it grow a lot It chewed right through the
lock and ate all the new kids on the block
Society's been so good to me my parents paid for my college education
Majoring in biotechnology created a
beast and now it's after me
Two heads of terrorYoung Jim as a lad he looked for adventure calamity danger whatever
was free So when he turned ten he
packed his belongings and he left home to find his destiny Jim just a
boy who's head full of legends of dungeons
and dragons and pirates and stuff So that summer he nuck on a schooner
to harpoon tuna and get real buff
The Captain he said There's danger ahead we need some brave men to
sail and then we'll find us those pirates

Cleaning up the oceans CAPTAIN HAMPTON and his crew Trouble in
the seven seas he'll know what

and scurby dogs are crushed under his
foot CAPTAIN HAMPTON CAPTAIN HAMPTON Ahoy Ahoy Pillaging the
Pillagers triumphantly he'll sail
away hey hey
Now seven weeks into the trip and Jim was sick to death of being sick
Some kind of action he wanted as he
searched the seas for everyday was the same old stuff The night he
felt like jumping ship but then he heard a
crash hit the starboard side of the ship and bumped him out of his bunk
onto his bottom Our heroes drew their
swords as the MIDGETS swarmed aboard The PIRATES surprise attack the
tiny buccaneers caught us by
surprise as we tried to battle back
Cleaning up the oceans CAPTAIN HAMPTON and his crew Trouble in
the seven seas he'll know what
to do CAPTAIN he hates rubbish to him pirates are just soot Scallywags

triumphantly he ran awayOnce upon a time she was fine and good people knew her name I was
from the ocean floor but I remember the
look in her eyes True love the birds would sing and the trees would
call her name as she walked by Love was
grand until that magic day she turned me into NOTHING
Let's talk about something else I'm starting not to see
myself She went so far away but I still see her
everyday NOTHING let's talk about something else before I cry waa
waa waaaaa
She can't see me but I can I guess I am the invisible man She can't
see what would be nothing hurts worse than
being NOTHING The invisible man some things are hard to understand
The invisible man nothing worse than
turning into
Once upon a time she was fine and good people knew her name I was on
the outside where all the animals and all
the trees were happy What's wrong I'm standing over here it's just
weird that she can't see me It's as if she
waved her magic wand and somehow turned me into NOTHING
The invisible man some things are hard to understand The invisible
man nothing worse than turning into She
can't see me but I can I guess I am the invisible man She can't see
what could be changed her mind and turned
me into NOTHINGSee them creep out to nightlife
You see them walk the streets
These children of the undead look dressed for the endless Halloweens
and this horror like production
takes total dedication
of black clothes and pale complexions
Rock jet black hair and monster makeup
And who can blame them
They walk through asphalt cemeteries
Zombie fashions
They must have been born that way
So can you hear me
Can you get hip to what I'm saying
These fashion zombies don't walk this world alone
So lock those doors and windows
They crawl the malls to shop
For tight black jeans and spiky belts
and scissors for the Zelda cut
and there is no explanation
These creatures are just victims
Dressed in expensive fashions
To look like they crawled out of coffins
And who can blame them
They walk through asphalt cemeteries
Zombie fashions
They must have been born that way
So can you hear me
Can you get hip to what I'm saying
These fashion zombies don't walk this world alone
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To accessorize their black zipper hood
and monster children with monster faces
Are looking for love in all the wrong places
And who can blame them
They walk through asphalt cemeteries
Zombie fashions
They must have been born that way
So can you hear me
Can you get hip to what I'm saying
These fashion zombies don't walk this world alone
So can you hear me
Can you get hip to what I'm saying
These fashion zombies don't walk this world aloneWe came from an island
In the sand and the sun
Hidden away from the world
Is that home of fun
We surfed all day
And ate food all night
When there was no more food
Eating sand was alright
But then one dark day out of the sky
Space Monster M and friends
Invaded our world
And we had to escape
But we vowed to return again
First we'd take over the world
And then we'd return again
We floated across the ocean
In a hollowed out log
From the blue beaches
To the land of smog
We washed up on the beach
The Professor took us in
And that's when the experiments begin
He gave us super powers from chemicals
Then he gave us instruments
So we could rock and roll
Now we're here to fight
To make our foes and friends
To take your money and go home againUh oh uh oh  Whoopsie
Uh oh uh oh  Whoopsie
Uh oh uh oh  Whoopsie
Uh oh uh oh
I had a birthday and grandma gave me money
She said
Don't spend it all in one place honey
Then I got twenty bucks
For Columbus Day
And I found sixtyfive in The Everglades
Oh can't you see me
Check a look at me
Running round town on a shopping spree
GGGot some new skis
And some break dance shoes
Like boogaloo shrimp
And a shabbadoo

I spent all my money I can't believe myself
I spent all my money I can't believe myself
I bought some tropical fish
For my Japanese cat
And some ostrich feathers
For my black leather hat
Got some shiny gold rings
And an Xray machine
So I can take a few pictures
Of the inside of me
Oh can't you see me
Can't you see me oh
Running round town like an Eskimo
In a fuzzy fur coat
On a fondue bike
This is my money baby
Gonna buy what I like

Whoops
I dropped it I dropped it I dropped
You got some money
And POOF It's gone again
That's just the way it goes
No No No don't you worry
You just go to grandma's house
That's where the money tree grows
So come one come on come on
Let's spend some money now
So come on come on come on
Roll up those quarters
So come on come on come on
Let's spend some money now
So come on come on come on
I'm a shark fighter I fight sharks
I fight 'em in the water 'cuz that's where they are
When I smell blood I come running
Then I put them in a shark cage
'Cuz my life to hunt down the creature I despise
Is full of danger
Whose eyes  those dead black marbles they call eyes 
This rhyme tells the story of the
Shark Fighter toughest man in the sea
Shark Fighter with his wavy blond hair flowing so freely
I had a girl who was precious to me but a shark took her away you see
Now I fight sharks not for money but for love 
And here's why I will avenge my lady with my life
Or until I die in a fight against the underwater army of the night
This rhyme tells the story of the
Shark Fighter toughest man in the sea
Shark Fighter with his wavy blond hair flowing so freely
His only goal is a shark casserole
His only creed is to make sharks bleed
He is not mean he's just getting even
He will not die 'til all sharks cry
I gots me a knife a bandanna and a topaz necklace
Yeah I'm extremely reckless I ride an otter like a motorcycle
Yeah I'm not kidding man Yeah I'm not kidding man
I'M NOT KIDDING MAN YOU KNOW I'M JUST A
Shark Fighter toughest man in the sea
Shark Fighter with his wavy blond hair flowing so freely
His only goal is a shark casserole
His only creed is to make sharks bleed
He is not mean he's just getting even
He will not die 'til all sharks cry
It's good crack its back2back
Knocking out the flavours
Of the penny arcade
Back2back style

A light shown in the night some way ahead thenblue turned into green then it was red
And light shone in the night as loud music played the light that shone in the night was a penny arcade

Step up and play each machine seemed to sayas I walked round and round the penny arcade

Just ring the bell on the big bagatelle that'll make all the colored lights cascade
And music played in the penny arcade yes it played and it played played all the time
Roll up and spend your last dime
At first I thought it was a dream that I was in lost lost in a sea of glass and tin
But no that was not to be dipped my hand in my jeans I grabbed a handful of coins to feed the machines


Roll up and spend your last roll up and spend your last
Roll up and spend your last dime
You've just been pimped back2back styleOh the boardwalk's deserted
There's nobody down by the shore
And the Ferris wheel ride isn't turning around anymore
The heat wave and the crowds are just old news
But I've still got some sand in my shoes

Brings mem'ries of the salty air

Whoa the blanket that we used to share
How we fell in love down by the sea
Comes back to me with the sand in my shoes
Whoa oh
When the water was cold
You would tremble and hold me so tight
And we'd sit on the beach just to wait for the stars to come out at night
The heat wave and the crowds are just old news
But I've still got some sand in my shoes

Oh brings mem'ries of the salty air

Whoa the blanket that we used to share
How we fell in love down by the sea
Comes back to me with the sand in my shoes

Whoa

Whoa la la la la uhwhoa

WhoauhohohYou can dance every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye let him hold you tight
You can smile every smile for the man
Who held your hand 'neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me hmm
Oh I know that the music's fine 
Like sparkling wine go and have your fun
Laugh and sing but while we're apart

But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me hmm
Baby don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it when we touch
I will never never let you go

All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
Any time my little world is blue
I just have to look at you
And every thing seems to be some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace

And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderfulThere goes my girl
There goes my first love
With the guy I used to call my friend
There goes love I thought would never end
And I can't forget her
My heart is breaking
When I see her holding hands with him
Can't help thinking how it might have been
She's still my first love
My first love is still around She never left this part of town
Now I see her most ev'ry day but she don't look my way
There goes my first love with the guy I used to call my friend
She loved me but not for long I wish I knew where I went wrong
Now ev'ry day those pretty feet come walking on down the street
There goes my first love with the guy I used to call my friendYou know the landlord rang my front door bell
I let it ring for a long long spell
I looked through the window I peeked through the blind
And asked him to tell me what was on his mind
He said Money honey
Money honey
Money honey
If you want to get along with me
I was cleaned and skinned and so hardpressed
I called the woman that I love the best
I finally reached my baby 'bout a half past three
She said I'd like to know what you want with me
I said Money honey
Money honey
Money honey
If you want to get along with me
She screamed and said What's wrong with you
From this day on our romance is through
I said Tell me baby face to face
Ahow could another man take my place
She said Money honey
Money honey
Money honey
If you want to get along with me
Well I learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the wind may blow
Women may come and the women may go
But before I say I love 'em so
I want money honey
Money honey
Money honey
If you want to get along with me
 Well make some money
 Well I ain't jivin' you honey
 You better give up some money
If you want to get along with meThey say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't got enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere
They say the girls are somethin' else
On Broadway 
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues 
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes 
They say that I won't last too long on Broadway 
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say 
But they're wrong I know they are
I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star
On Broadway 
But they're wrong I know they are
I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway 
On Broadway

I'll have my name in lights 
Everybody gonna know me

Your tasty kiss thrills me so
Sweets for my sweet sugar for my honey

And we're gonna have a ball
Just like we always do
Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're huggin' with your baby
In the last row in the balcony
Well there's technicolor and cinemascope
A cast out a Hollywood
And the popcorn from the candy stand
Makes it all seem twice as good
There's alway lots of pretty girls
With figures they don't try to hide
But they never can compare
To the girl sittin' by my side
Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're huggin' with your baby
In the last row in the balcony
Ah Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're huggin' with your baby
In the last row in the balcony
Ah Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're huggin' with your baby
In the last row in the balcony
Yeah Saturday night at the moviesIt's such a small town girl news travels faster than a sigh
Everybody wants to know about the next man's secret so everytime we meet upon the street we've got to keep it
Like sister and brother we'll wave to each other we don't want all the world to know we are really lovers
So we'll talk about the weather 'til we're alone together
And all the world will fade and die and baby there is only you and I
You and me baby you and me baby
Sometimes it's hard to hide pent up emotions we both feel
I want to tell the world I love you but I dare not say it
Until I let you go there's only one way we can play it
Like sister and brother we'll wave to each other we don't want all the world to know we are really lovers
So we'll talk about the weather 'til we're alone together
And all the world will fade and die and baby there is only you and I
Like sister and brother We'll wave to each other we don't want all the world to know 
We are really lovers so we'll talk about the weather 'til we're alone together and all the world will fade and die and baby there is only you and I
Like sister and brother We'll wave to each other we don't want all the world to knowDoo doo
Doop doop doop doo doop
Doo doo
Doop doop doop doo doop
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where those treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow the snow
Then III am dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days may your days may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
III am dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
III am dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May those days may your days may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle bells all the way oooSay you'll meet me down on the beach tonight
Where you and I can dance till break of day
Underneath the stars to soft guitars
There's gonna be an all night party
Say you'll meet me down on the beach tonight
Where you and I can dance your tears away
Barefoot in the sand hand in hand
We're gonna have all night party
Hey little girl you know he won't call up again
He's out there on the town with your best friend
Don't wait all night by the window you know it had to end
You might as well come down and have a good time
Say you'll meet me down on the beach tonight
Where you and I can dance 'till break of day
Underneath the stars to soft guitars
There's gonna be an all night party
Say you'll meet me down on the beach tonight
Where you and I can dance your tears away
Barefoot in the sand hand in hand
We're gonna have all night party
Little girl he'll always be the cheating kind
I knew that he would soon step out of line
So don't cry all night on your pillow 'cause he ain't worth the time
You might as well come down and join the party
Say you'll meet me down on the beach tonight
Where you and I can dance 'till break of day
Underneath the stars to soft guitars
There's gonna be an all night party
Say you'll meet me down on the beach tonight
Where you and I can dance your tears away
Barefoot in the sand hand in hand
We're gonna have all night partyThe way I feel tonight
I'm afraid I don't know wrong from right
All I know is that it's plain to see
You are never coming back to me
The way I feel for you
I would borrow beg or steal for you
But it doesn't matter what I vow
What's the good it's too late now
You may believe I've never loved you
Some of our friends have told you so
But why should you listen to friends dear
For who in this wide world can know
The way I feel inside
With a heart that just can't be denied
You would find a love that's deep and real
If you knew the way I feelHivemind is scary I feel vulnerable and stupid
Waiting for a new embarrassment to go and tear right through me A dependent fruitless animal watch me brimming with shame
This confidence I fake only makes matters worse I am not a stallion I am just perverse Hopeless and docile and tamed
Another day I won't remember another day I wished away
Tedious days punctuated by dismay everyday feels the same
It's the routine and it's the regret
That makes me worse yet
Did I forget your name or make a joke and noone laughed
Did I come across as stupid or did I cum too fast
This isn't a brave face this is a mask
Now I remember it doesn't take much to make me feel smallI feel like a leech to everyone around me
unsure and false promises I make
I invade your existence with my dependence
and leave you guilt tripped until you take
care of me for If not I will surely die
I don't feed or clean myself and I am always high
putting pipe dreams before the necessities in life
Without your help I have no hope to survive
Now I know that sounds pathetic
that's because that's what I am
So open about my flaws
but it's all part of my plan
For If I can recognize my flaws
you'll assume I'm trying to change
but I am lazy and disheartened
and I know I will remain the same
Taking all you can give me trying to live in excess
You know you'll make my life much easier I'll make your life a mess
Squirm away stupid leech boy go and die now in the drain
you speak only of your sadness but are yet to feel true pain
As I get older I also worsen
I used to be a better person
Growing into a constant burden
Introducing man child
I am scared I'll lose my job because I always go in stoned
If I do will you feed me take me in and hear me moan
If you don't I'm on your concience and will surely die alone
Invite me in to regret it as I take over your home
Oh so useless and demanding no I will not help out with chores
I'll bring no money or conversation Unmotivated and bored
Staring blankly into space absorbing all you have worked for
I will dissapoint those who think I can do more
I warn you now to avoid me
I may not bite the hand that feeds
but I will wrap my lips around it
and I will suck off all the meat
You'll be left feeling used once you find out I'm a leech
I'll take all yuo can give and then I will up and leave
No shame or dignity left in me as I scout out brand new friends
to invade with my dependence and let it start again
I don't feel that prejudice
Can't see divided lines
To me we are all just the same
Our difference in our souls and minds
You tell me that the difference
Is red brown black and white
A world of such variety
To you becomes an excuse for hate

We've gotta learn have hope unite
And care enough to end this fight
You're hating with no real insight
And burning crosses in the night
A hundred years of barriers
Yet still we can't see fit
To bring about world unity
And learn to live with it
Now I'm not just complaining
And I won't preach to anyone
But we should think about it
'Cos this war has not just begun
Do you think that all blacks are niggers
Ignorance is an attitude
You wallow in your racist stupor
Have you really stopped to think
Do you believe in the KKK do you think White Power rules today
Would you like to shoot a white man dead would you like to bust
a black man's head  No way
In England there's the National Front headstrong bunch these fuckin' cunts
With Webster as their figurehead they liberate Hitler as he lies dead
They think they're so bloody tough pakibashing ain't enough
Martin Webster like the KKK map out all the plans his own way

Racism sucks 
Racism fucking sucks
Some black folks call the white race scum cos they think we are the only ones
Who only live in prejudice while a lot of blacks live just the same
Do you really judge a man by the color of his skin
You got the color you got no right to fuck up everybody else's life

Kill kill the KKK Destroy Martin Webster
Kill kill the KKK Destroy Ronald ReaganHey man I remember just a few short years ago
Talked through letters mutual interest
We were always on the phone
I have thought about you many times
Even I didn't know
Started crossing paths and sounds
And how we understand the dreams that goo
And even now you can be here
Though you're far away
All the times you lifted me so high
I can't forget
And different faces different scenes
Still seems so far away
But it's always great to be with you again
Times have been so strange
So many people in and out
Getting older in my age
While these freedom thoughts stay young
I can thank you for the inspiration
And the honesty you gave
And the times those feelings came to me
During tough times where I thought of giving up so
And even now you can be here
Though you're far away
All the times you lifted me so high
I can't forget
And different faces different scenes
Still seems so far away
But it's always great to be with you againMan's thrown all alone
Wonders what he'll conquer
Woman she's the one
Power's what she owns
Didn't try didn't hafta
As man takes on the world
Man makes the mistakes
Blames it on his mother
She laughs then she cries
She plans understands
Watches as he falters
Man starts every war

And I wanna join
Cuz I know who's side I'm on
And I need to know
What she thinks
His greed in history
His is so inflated
His way go away
He learned young
To be strong
At least his version of it
Man I'm so ashamed
Uptight might is right
The proof is in the package
Boys don't ever cry
Sister teaches strong
She's the pure creator
She rules everything

There's a million things to tell you but the words get in my way
I mean here I stand before you there's not one single thing to say
You're the one that picks me up when my life has gone astray
You're the kicker to my heartbeat you're the words that I can't say
Do you think I'm laughing you know you don't realize when it comes to dealing with me you know I can sympathize
Sometimes I feel like I'm your struggle don't want to be
I'd rather be your never ending I'd rather be your deep inside When you cry I wish I could be a salty tear from your eye Would you swallow me so I could be so much closer to your soulWe're gonna fight
We know who's right

Time to unite
We're having our say

With a 
They don't ask squat

You stand up tall
The futures ours


Me and you
We're gonna fight the narrow minds
Make our own rules
Live your life at all
Live six long years
And a thousand strong

We're not dumb
We're oh we're

Angry kids
With a million rules

We got our dreams
And we got our hopes

Me and you
We're gonna fight the narrow minds
Make our own rules
Live your life at all
Live life
Me and you
We're gonna fight the narrow minds
Make our own rules
Live your life at all
Live
Me and you
We're gonna fight the narrow minds
Make our own rules
Live your life at all
Live life
Life
My life
Mine
I live mine
Mine
YEAAHH
We're Gonna Fight
Whoahoahoa 

Fight 
Fight For what is right
We're gonna fight
We're gonna fight
We're gonna
Right
Huh
YEAAHH
We're Gonna Fight
Whoahoahoa Something's creeping up your way
With cans of pain and things to say
We wait until the dead of night
Then nail everything in sight

We will attack in red and black
Cover the buildings the walls and the street
We will attack in red and black
Graveyard graffiti this whole fucking city
Lots of kids with nothing to do
Important in the eyes of few
A town with nothin' for the young
An so our crusade has begun
You pay your money to get in
You're ready for some fun
But once you get in you're afraid
To get close to anyone
You dance around real tough and mean
Got macho thrash appeal
Your image here is what's at stake
And not the way you feel
In the pit you can't be yourself
You're an image of what's cool
And you ignore your friends
Just another fool
The hole grows bigger by the second
And soon there's no one left
No arms in arms cos in your eyes
It looks too fucking queer
But what's wrong with our unity
Friends having fun as friends
That pit is just a barrier
And soon we hope to endSome years gone by but I believe  Still
And in my heart I still feel  Real
I'd rather die before I'd call it quits
Cos I can't feel the way that you feel
A commitment that will remain inside
Just something I will never forget
Don't tell me that it's just my pride
A built in part of what's inside my head
I've sacrificed a lot and still feel strong  Still
But odds were that it wouldn't last for long  Wrong
Beliefs and views get stronger every way
Tell me friend just where you stand today
People say I've changed say I'm much different now
I've lost friends jobs money so tell me why
Let me hear your reasons cuz I shaved my head
And it changed my head
What about our friendship you say I'm such a bore
And I'm too hardcore
Now you just ignore me well fuck you man
Are you happy now
Promises were broken but who broke them firstLook at all the good things
In this life that you have got
You got security and comfort
With a roof above your head
Yet you may find it easy
To sit back and complain
I know I've done it many times
When I've felt no pain
But what is right
If we can't look around and face the facts
Just go through life
Without a conscience or a care
It seems it's dog eat dog
'Til you're the one they're all looking to bite
Convinced that you're so justified
But what is right what's justified
Now things are getting clearer
Day by day this feeling's strong
And as we take a step
It's hard to get along
And just when I think it's over
Oh I feel that drive begin
'Cause it's not what I take
But what I must put in in my life
But what is right
If we can't look around and face the facts
Just go through life
Without a conscience or a care
It seems it's dog eat dog
'Til you're the one they're all looking to bite
Convinced that you're so justified
But what is right what's justified
And as the story's told
The problem's harsh and cold
We've got to end it
With warmth inside the heart
And knowledge that's a start
We've got to end it yeah
Push for change why help suppress it
Realize you're not alone
Honor life why help regress it
Can't you see it starts at home
But what is right
If we can't look around and face the facts
Just go through life
Without a conscience or a care
It seems it's dog eat dog
'Til you're the one they're all looking to bite
Convinced that you're so justified
But what is right what's justifiedBusy with this special thing that takes me far away
Living for the music if the spirit's gone why did it fade
I see you every once in a while so little I can say
I know how things have gone for you you seem so far away 

Tied up tied up in rhythm that's my crime to you
And everything keeps getting tied up tied up so tight I don't know why
You walked beside me every step until a dream had found
A spot that drove me harder and harder I keep pushing on
I hope you won't forget me the way I treated you
Until I slow down a bit I don't know what to do 
I always think about you alone or with the band
Just having something very special now can it last very long
Do you doubt just how I feel can you tell that it's for real
Just sharing certain feelings we all know
The truth down from within

Listen but I can only show you at times it's so hard with life
We've gone this far and made it work
You've got to know that part is true
Can you tell that what I say comes from my heart it's taken time
To make me find your heart I don't mind
You seem to doubt my sincerity I'm hoping that you see
Just try to look much deeper then you'll know just how I feel
Will you try to understand sometimes I may get out of hand
But knowing that you're by my sideAction's being taken 'cos of this
You fucked with us and now we're really pissed
A hundred times you tried to shut us out
But silence isn't golden hear us shout

Can't you see we're just too fast
Diehard youth we're made to last 
Diehard youth we're comin'See you out there it's like you'll dance the night away
But the feelings aren't too good because you need to lead the way
You call them friends but now to you they have no air to breath
And when the time is right you know you'll have to have the final say

Music makes you feel good so why make it a drag
Too boots the fist the stance you're out to win a loser's game
How hard is it to take them when size is on your side
Too blind to see it's just a shame when music's played in vain
Big man with mean face now are you bigger than you seem
Find time to push around and bring it down until there's nothing left
Our music and our message out of love more than exists
Are you there to hear it stop now are you there to see it end
I grew up with love and affection
Know what it means to spread that infection
No matter waht may stand in my way
This energy within it guides me day by day
At times when I feel there is no way out
I'll bitch cry moan whine scream and shout
But what I'd like to see in the world most today
We've got to SPREAD IT SPREAD IT
Now I know you must be thinking
There is something wrong
How could I have the nerve
To write this song
Well it's like I've got this feeling
Stripped away of pride
A crazy mixed up feeling
That I just can't hide
Emotion is this great thing
We've all got it let it show
If u can share emotion
Then by all means let me know
And if we wanna make a better world today
SPREAD IT SPREAD IT THIS WORLD OVER GOAll my days in so many ways I've seen it
This prejudice I've seen it twist and turn
I've cried at thoughts of not bein' able to stop it
And now I ache away for it's here so strong today
What are you organizing for
Put up another door
Just stop and look around
Say you must see
The blindness we have here
You say you've heard it all before
And you'll hear it again
Just go ahead and close us off
But you'll still feel the pain that you create
Our peace comes from within
And I think war does too
Believe in love and you'll get what is due
Skin yellow red brown black and white
Can't stop to see that no no
Only single hearts and minds inside our heads
What are you organizing for
Put up another door
Just stop and look around
Say you must see
The blindness we have here
You say you've heard it all before
And you'll hear it again
Just go ahead and close us off
But you'll still feel the pain that you create
Oh Gandhi when you look at us
Does your heart ache
How could you think that
Peace in this world has a place
Well I believe in peace not pride or race
To set our future days future ways
And I can only hope
We don't keep blowin' it all away
What are you organizing for
Put up another door
Just stop and look around
Say you must see
The blindness we have here
You say you've heard it all before
And you'll hear it again
Just go ahead and close us off
But you'll still feel the pain that you createI grew up with love and affection
Know what it means to spread that infection
No matter waht may stand in my way
This energy within it guides me day by day
At times when I feel there is no way out
I'll bitch cry moan whine scream and shout
But what I'd like to see in the world most today

And if we wanna make a better world today
SPREAD IT SPREAD IT THIS WORLD OVER GOI'm not sorry 'cause I started growing and I'm pushing on
And I know I cannot turn it back or turn away
So many feelings moving faster as I live from day to year
It seems that now I live a lifetimein a day

Stand by my side I know it's hard 'cause we're afraid I know I am
Please understand it's time to grow more than you know
Just a part of the same old story it seems so old
But tell me why I can't take hold I can't explain
Words go through my head and I ache for ways to see
I guess this madness is the answerI'm afraid
A street with bodies filled with guts
Child's world is such a mess
One bomb could rip this place apart
Yet who's to blame where'd it start

America's War 
Just one more war by '84
It's killin' me and killin' you
These enemies want a little taste
Of what's left of American waste

Our government they gave the world
With non of our voices ever heard
A silence first and then a scream
So much for the American Dream
For once in my life I've got something to say
I wanna say it now for now is today
A love has been given so why not enjoy
So let's all grab and let's all enjoy
If the kids are united then we'll never be divided
If the kids are united then we'll never be divided
Just take a look around you what do you see
Kids with feelings like you and me
Understand him he'll understand you
For you were him and he was you
If the kids are united then we'll never be divided
If the kids are united then we'll never be divided
I don't want to be rejected
I don't want to be denied
Then its not my misfortune
That I've opened up your eyes
Freedom is given to speak how you feel
I have my freedom how do you feel
They can lie to my face but not to my heart
If we all stand together it will just be the start
If the kids are united then we'll never be divided
If the kids are united then we'll never be dividedTake your pick and make a stand
With no regrets or change of plan
Keep your head don't be afraid
Be proud of the choice you've made
Support your scene you must believe
Never stop just move ahead

Oh Oh Oh Definite Choice
Be positive no ignorance
To mindlessness we must protest
'Cause we're for real we're gonna prove
That our movement's on the move
Fuck big business church and war
That's not what we're fighting for
See those kids so young and free
I guess that's how it use ta be
So caught up in themselves they just don't see
But standing hard gives us this right
To put up walls and to prove our might
And faster faster must the music go
Farewell to seven years
We bid a fond so long
To seven years
Why'd it take so long
They're waitin' for old times again
If they support they'll understand
Our message calls for unity not rage
We see so many ways
To vent the anger in our troubled hearts
Without using it to smash up someone else
Farewell to seven years
We bid a fond so long
To seven years
Why'd it take so long
And it takes so longAll you talk about is you
But we've got better things to do
You're proving that you're tough and shit
But we're for real and don't forget

We're fun you're not
We play we fight
You're off we're not
That chip is all you got
You go out and fight the world
Beat up boys and beat up girls
And nothing's gonna change your ways
You look at us but we just say

Now another bully comes
Beats your ass away you run
He'll be here to wear the crown
'Til another comes aroundI guess the others turned their backs on what they now call shit
It doesn't really matter 'cause it's their words I forget
If 'core is dead they've moved along and now they're rockin' out
But I have doubts they ever knew just what it's been about

But I still believe I still believe believe in myself 
Watch them bite and clw now as they line up on the rack
A method to success and now there ain't no looking back
They're playing better music with a message aimed at other crowds
And they don't include a lyrics sheet 'cause what they say ain't proud

from The Crew
Hey now I've this feeling
That I've never felt before
I know it ain't cool to say this now
But I can't help the way I feel inside
Around you I can be the way I am
Be happy pissed or sad
But the things I always think about
Are the feelings we have shared
Chorus 'Cos when we are together there is something
That I have with you trust
And as we're growin' closer I can feel it
Flowing out from you trust
I hope you can feel the same way that I do trust
If there's one thing now between us that's a must trust
Look now we can share emotion
Something that we both thought was just too tough
Aggression love and honesty
There could never be enough
All I wanna do is just let you know that I care
And when things get too hard for you
Look back and I'll be there

You inspire me intensely
Without any doubt
You keep me thinking help me try
Show that I can do without
With you there's more foundation
More than any other time
And when it comes to you my heart is true
Until the day I die
Hatred I can't stand it anymore
The color of our skin we must ignore
Do you feel the pain or see the hurt
Or do you let it pass right by instead

This fighting dividing y'know we'll only lose 
How come we can stand for such a crime
Racial hate a real sign of the times
We've gotta raise our voice begin the fight
And equal world held high is in our sight

Is this prejudice a way of life tell me
Do you wanna be just like your friends pressure
Is it 'cos you just jumped by someone is it
You're condemning those who choose to live unfairHe said Come along that urge has come again and now I'm feeling strong
Expectations of you don't care is you want to want along
Love for those who make it without knowing how another feels
The fact is what you do is rape it never crossed your mind before

An opinion of feelings
It's just pride no real depth
Opinion of feelings
Do those feelings mean anything at all
He's pulled you down he's taking aim you wonder what he's waiting for
And he may get his way this time but will he ever change your mind
A sharp resentment guilt deep pain all this in the act of love
And now you're just a victim of his gain a selfish gameHey it's 1984
With a glimpse of what's in store
It looks like things are up to us
No talk just action in the streets
That's what it's gonna take
No calm youth in the USA

It's summertime American riot
I can't complain unless I try it
The heat is here a teenage warning
To those who fear here's your warning
This could be the year
That we could make some people think
With smarter minds we'll hit the streets
United we must make our stand
Divided we will fall
But it's up to us to take that step

Complacent kids that's all they want
But if they want trouble they'll get it
Amidst years of youth unrest
And now someone is pissed right
Got that crazy feeling
Scared you don't know why
Head is spinning faster
Haze is in your eyes
And now you take a deep breath
Wipe sweat off your face
Your head and heart keep pounding
Sets a frenzied pace
Now the wall gets stronger
Bodies hitting hard
Air is thick and heavy
No room left to breathe
Now you feel the tension
Eyes are open wide
Nothing like this feeling
Aggression deep insideMan you've gotta problem who made you fuckin' king
A macho pig with nothing in your head
No girls around you their place is not at gigs
Don't want 'em on the dance floor 'cos they're weak
A woman's place the kitchen on her back
It's time to change that attitude and quick

Showing us your phobias you're scared to see 'em think
You'd rather dress 'em up in pretty lace
All nice and colored pink
You feel so fucking threatened
When they stand out in front
A stupid passive piece of meat is all you really want
But it's
Not just boys' fun 
There's girls who put out fanzines others put on shows
Yet they're not allowed to get out on the floor
Some make the music well that you can accept
Hell maybe live you'll get some tits and ass
You fucking moron your brains have run amuck
A girl's only lot in life is not to fuck
It's hard to tell you how I feel exactly what do I say
These feelings from within for now they just get in my way
It seems that lately for some reason we've been torn apart
A bond so strong at one point has it been blown away

I'm gonna say this now and I won't hold back
Have our hearts grown apart do we still have a chance
Do we still have those hopes and dreams
And then I feel like giving in forgetting what's been said
Pretend like things are just the way they were when we were young
To share emotions we have shared in friendship brotherhoodHow come everything you say is right
How come everything I say is wrong
You never ever open your mind
You never seem to hear the things I say

'Cos you're the boss have a say
Everything must go your way
But count me out I'm not about to listen
You judge me from your upper point of view
Judge from what I say and what I do
Tell me that you understand you care
But when I speak you're never fucking there
Prejudice throughout the land don't look at us we're antiKlan
Black hates white white hates black
Tell me why I don't understand

I don't want a fuckin' race war  No way
I don't want no segregated schools  No way
I wanna have the right to choose my friends  Fuck you
I don't want your narrow minded ways
Racial groups they plan attack
I guess they think we won't fight back
I care about all human beings
And not the color of their skin
You lie with ease right to my face
You look straight in my eyes
No task for you you cannot see
Between truth and dishonesty
Friends so long yet you still try
To force feed me your fucking lies
I hear your lies how come I'm the lucky one
I see your lies glorify what you haven't done
I hate your lies stories different every time
5 years of lies 12 1234
You talk about the girls you know
The asses that you've kicked
Sometimes I sit in disbelief
Wondering what you really think
What I strive for you laugh about
Behind my fucking back no doubt7 Seconds
The Crew
This Is The Angry 
Tired of hearing us moan and complain
Just 'cos you don't feel it
Doesn't mean there's no pain
Brought up then let down and run through the course
Able to fuck us and feel no remorse

This is a cry for the ones who can't fight
We're just the bad seeds who didn't turn out right
We'll get a chance and we'll break down the door
This is the angry the young and the poor
Turned on your own kicked the dirt in our face
We're stuck without money no working no pace
Just think what you'd do if you were in our place
Reality's waiting while you take up space


you wanna be the way i am
but you could never understand
you shave your fuckin head
then you turn your back
on your best friends

it's not just in my head
it's in my heart

and you're not gonna
tear this one apart
the way you look it fits
how come your attitude is shit
you say you do it your own way
but now i have the price to pay

if i can give a fuck
you better start so
use your head be aware
give a fuck
the same routine fuck up again
you have no real regrets
but this is not just something
i can easily forget

i can't believe you've come this far
yet still so unaware
no cause no brains no fire inside
when will you learn to careExcuse me just wait one sec have you ever really listened to a thing we've said
You're not convinced that we could ever be a major force
But just another youth subculture with a different song
But for others there's this other side
not really looking for some credit for the things we've tried
Communication it could work so fast
Just 'cause now you say it's over does that make it past

We could be the new wind  oh oh
We could be the new wind  Do you know do you care
We could be the new wind  oh oh
We could be the new wind  Will you try will you dare
A simple dream no not just that can you just appreciate there's something we must find
I'm not a punker just a human being with this urge to exercise
What's in my heart and mind
It's not me hiding from reality pretend that I can shine it turn around and walk away
The contradiction seems to follow you assuring that there is really nothing we can't doRomper room you think it's fun play your games on everyone
Do your best to be a fool think you're cute think it's cool

Don't you be a bit surprised that maybe soon they'll realize
3 of you and you're the same busy playing baby games
Run around like 2 yearolds the way you act is getting old
Talk behind our backs I say monkey see's the only way
You tell me you're beaten in search of a way
To know when to leave and to know when to stay
Here people accept all the smart lies confined
Forget all that nonsense let's leave it behind

I saw it and I see it keeps getting closer yet
This Freedom Landscape fades oh
To hold it don't mold it just place it on your heart
This Freedom Landscape fades
This is my tribute to you my dear one
Do you feel your skin burn while you pray to the sun
I know there's a reason we scream on the phone
I'd rather stand off than to stand here alone


Some houses feel warm oh so good I can see
What's looming ahead in the future for me
And hands make great comfort but will they be here
When I'm reaching waiting as trouble comes near
I will wait and if you give a sign
I'll hold on until the end of time
So you're tired of hearing us moan and complain
Just 'cos you don't feel it
Don't mean there's no pain
Some are brought up and let down
Then run through the course
While they're able to fuck us and feel no remorse

Oh Oh Oh 
Well you've turned on your own
Kicked dirt in our faces
We're left with no money no work no paces
Just think what you'd do
If you were in our place
While reality's waiting you're taking up space

Are you happy Are you proud
Then sing real loud

Note The original version of this song appeared on a
7 EP called Committed for Life and it featured an actual chorus
which the diehard fans used to sing whenever Kev tried to sing the
new whoaoh chorushe apparently found the original too negative
on later thoughtlive The original version followsif what you see is what you get
just look toward us and never fret
i'll sing this 'till i can't no more
a part of what i'm waiting for
it's there so strong and can you see
a force and what we have is strength

and what we have is STRENGTH
all we need it's what we gotWhen will we find a balance
Such unfair things we see
Small troubled nations crumble
And freedom falls from dust to dust
Remember people are just flesh and bone
And blood and tears and soul
Where the past's led us to the present
Where the future will unfold

And I have some ideas though I realize
I might be blind
I ask so many questions
I keep leaving thoughts behind
Still searchin' ain't like wasting time
At least there is this bottom line
We need to find some sort of balance
Along the way
Until they see the way
It's meant to be on this lonesome soil
I think it might take a while
The answers wait unanswered while we're
Too scared to lift our heads
War justifies some feelings
Helps us find a taste for blood
I think the enemy is anyone
Who has the guts to say
That nothing's wrong
That things are fine
That there's no reason to complain

I think it might take a while
But it's always freehaiiam ipn from indonesia HxC kidsi would you send me a lyrics REGRESS NOWAY from 7 secondbe couse in the 7 second and kevin second website is not found

The contradiction seems to follow you assuring that there is really nothing we can't doI woke up from a dream I could've sworn I heard the phone
Fan's blowing in the corner like it does when she's at home
Familiar desperate feeling always cold and dark inside
I'll probably sit here hoping soon that she'll be by my side
Yeah I saw her smile that chased the blues away
Her warmth will make it feel okay
'Cause it's one to go and one to stay I guess it has to be that way
I found my kindred spirit now she's with me as I sleep
And it's in her hands up to her where she'll put my soul to keep
Soul to keep
Out there in the hard world trying to blend into the day
A thousand different faces stare I try to look away
Well I can feel her move within me and her voice is in my head
And with that in mind I seem to find a way back home again
Saw her smile that chased the blues away
Her warmth will make it all okay
'Cause it's one to go and one to stay I guess it has to be that way
I found my kindred spirit now she's with me as I sleep
And it's in her hands up to her where she'll put my soul to keep
My soul to keep soul to keep soul to keep soul to keepSo you're tired of hearing us moan and complain
Just 'cos you don't feel it

Oh Oh Oh 
Well you've turned on your own
Kicked dirt in our faces
We're left with no money no work no paces
Just think what you'd do
If you were in our place
While reality's waiting you're taking up space

Are you happy Are you proud
Then sing real loud
It's not the way we look
It's not our stance our style our hair
Forget those stupid barriers
Take down that flag you wear
Just people living on
With different hearts and different minds
If we lived in the same world
Why can't we stand in the same line
If we can walk together
Why can't we rock together
If we can walk together
Why can't we rock together
No I don't care
If you're into different bands
No cause for so much hatred
I'm just a different man
Pull off the cover I will too
And learn to understand
With music deep inside
We'll make world our unity plan
If we can walk together
Why can't we rock togetherThe older I become
I can't help thinking hard about
What's really gonna happen
And what's in store for
Us and them is bullshit
And if we're gonna make it work
We've gotta care together
And see this too the end see it to the end

It'll take some time to fix it up
But that is something we must do
With solid hearts and clearer minds
We'll raise our voice and blast right through
We'll stop the ones who fuck it up
And show the world that they can't stop the crew
The crew is me the crew is you yeah we're the crew
The threat of war ain't over
And yes I fear it's getting near
With all this hate inside us
It all may just start
Here now will you listen
Or would you rather just ignore
You say we have no future
Do we have a chance Do we have a chance
Walk the streets you point at me yeah hardcore pride is what you see
Your insults are a parody cos you're so fucking scared of me

We're skinheads brains guts 
Call me ugly I don't care I feel good in the clothes I wear
Call me dumb I've gotta brain when I'm hurt I feel the pain

Smash this town to bits we do no one's gonna mess with you
Take 'em on we ain't afraid angry kids so hear us say
Hold out for the best one
Dig in deep to
Understand the routine
Understand the problem
Gotta shake foundations
Need to shun reactions
Only time will tell you
All the things you'll go through
And the world
Is your world
Will this feeling subside
Time to take a ride through
Different places thresholds
Can't be scared to try and
Give a little promise
You'll feel better
Any given moment
There's a heart that's broken
And the world
Is your world
Hey
And the world
Is your world
Will this feeling subside
Time to take a ride through
Different places thresholds
Can't be scared to try and
Give a little promise
You'll feel better
Any given moment
There's a heart that's broken
Hold itYou waited long for 21
For me the fight has just begun
You get in clubs drink alcohol
It makes you feel you're ten feet tall

I don't wanna grow up
I'm never getting old
I'd rather work from 9 to 5
Than drink to stay alive
I'm gonna stay young until I die 
You grew up fast now you'll die soon
I'll never fucking be like you
You finish college grab a wife
You're dead before you're 35
I don't need you to tell me what I've got to do
I'm counting all the days till I'm rid of you
Tell me what to do tell me what to say
But no more fuckers just get outta my way

'Cause this is  my life this is  my life
Stupid lame society you wanna take control of me
Parents wanna run my life some girls act like my fuckin' wife
I don't need you to tell me what I've got to do
I'm counting all the days till I'm rid of you
Tell me what to do tell me what to say
But no more fuckers just get outta my way

Get off my fuckin' back
Yeah you do drugs you know I don't
Yet it's a trend just 'cos I don't
Leave me be can't you see
I hate the way it fuckin' smells
I hate the way it makes me feel
Thumbs down to all those drugs you need
'Cos I'll just stay high naturally
Just more false starts it tears apart
Your heart hour head your soul your brain
It helps the feeling eases the painI just got back to routine it goes from day to day
I've got this sneaky feeling gets closer as we play
After months and months of planning hard work to hit the road
No sense of security you get when you're at home

And just for you there is a calendar not just a need for the time
But just 'cause you're on my mind
It's made of days this simple calendar
But it feels like years going by where do I cry
I've rearranged my whole life such things are hard for two
But still the music keeps me going and my heart is set on you
We see so many faces do cities look the same
I'll take this voyage anyway and hope someday you'll goStanding scared you've always been that way
Fight your own fight
Paranoia every single day
Fight your own fight
Afraid to take a chance and be involved
Fight your own fight
Your self pride is hanging on a rack
When will you stand up and help us be strong
How can you face life and live with yourself
Do you see justice in what they have done
You see confrontation and you turn and run
One of us gets beaten to a pulp
Fight your own fight
You just turn and look the other way
Fight your own fight
Unite we have but you're too fucking scared
Fight your own fight
Commit yourself  you never fucking dared
Fight your own fightEncouraged to speak shown every sign
Learned to never waste the time
Taught to have an open

Why give me a heart
When you won't let it beat
And I'm not afraid I've still got hope
But now you tell me I belong
Do I stay and sing this same old

Why give me a key
When you won't set me free
And you listen to our song
And you wonder what's going on
You say that growth's okay
But do it by the rules
But if I abide how will I grow or learn
Is this one big lie or have we been misled
It's time to practice what we preach
It's time to move ahead
Now I've lived awhile
Not much I haven't tried
But tell me what to do and you'll see
How high I can fly
Why give me the space
When you won't let me breathe
It's time to make things fresh
Bring in the new
Put our minds together
And see beyond this tunnel view
Why give me two eyes
When you won't let me see
And you listen to our song
And you wonder what's going on
You say that growth's okay
But do it by the rules
But if I abide how will I grow or learn
Is this one big lie or have we been misled
It's time to practice what we preach
It's time to move aheadStill I couldn't find my way to sleep
Lie still awake too much to think
When will this sound inside my head
Stop 'cause it makes me cry
Now I find I'm looking for something
Some fact or clue that helps to bring
A dizzy world focused and straight
This time I'm not feeling so
This time I'm not feeling so
This time I'm not feeling so great
Escape and run keeps going through my head
For what I face it seems I'm better dead
Escape and run keeps going through my mind
Instead of moving up I'm falling far behind
In sleep this slow part fills my dream
In black and white or so it seems
I've seen myself fall down and die
For in this dream I've lived a lie
Down with me breathe deep plant your faith
Look at the sky but don't you wait
A hundred voices in the end
This time I'm not feeling so great
Escape and run keeps going through my head
For what I face it seems I'm better dead
Escape and run keeps going through my mind
Instead of moving up I'm falling far behindNarrow minded rednecks such lame mentality
Believe in old time standards like guns and bigotry
They say they're proud of their home
This fine old USA
But asked what color is the one and see just what they say
Just what they say 

I'm stuck in a redneck society
Fools with age old morals want the same old thing
Money war racism with nothing in between
They don't want liberals in the way
They just sit back and see
Their power's in the White House and the moral majority
Majority 
I'm stuck in a redneck societyHere we sit like we have many times
Familiar feeling
Hear the change of thousands pouring in
Yeah dealers bosses white and black
There's eyes that watch us over
If there is a hell this must be it
Hope is all you started with
You've seen as you walk in
Doubtful they could be your friends
A game you can depend on
This wicked thing is sin
It's ugly when you reach the end
The time is nonexistent
Stranger people stay insistent
You may win but do you win a thing
Old hands now black from filthy money
Tickets from the pawn shops
Back tomorrow
Does this make much sense
Hope is all you started with
You've seen as you walk in
Doubtful they could be your friends
A game you can depend on
This wicked thing is sin
It's ugly when you reach the end
This town means nothing
This town will never grow
This town's a ghost town
You really outta know
Wheels spin the sounds of ringing
Pain inside my head
I think it's better just to find the edge
It's safe up here I'm staying
I'd rather watch some other's fail
Like a king up on this Copper LedgeYou and I in a little toy shop
Buy a bag of balloons with the money we got
Set them free at the break of dawn
Til one by one they were gone
Back at base bugs in the software
Flash the message something's out there
Floating in the summer sky
99 red balloons go by
99 red balloons floating in the summer sky
Panic bells it's red alert there's something here from somewhere else
The war machine springs to life opening one eager eye
Focusing it in the sky as 99 red balloons go by
99 decision street 99 ministers meet
To worry worry super scurry call the troops out in a hurry
This is what we've waited for this is it boys this is war
The president is on the line 99 red balloons go by
99 knights of the air ride super high tech jet fighters
Everyone's a superhero everyone's a Captain Kirk
With orders to identify to clarify and classify
Scramble in the summer sky as 99 red balloons go by
99 dreams I have had every one a red balloon
It's all over and I'm standing pretty in this dust that was a city
I could find a souvenir just to prove the world was here
And here's a red balloon I think of you and let it goI hate watching football games baseball is so fuckin' lame
TV sports they all suck shit Howard Cosell is a wimp
Chorus I hate sports 
I hate watching baseball games boxing is so fuckin' lame
Ali and his old age fame yeah he's a wimp he's fuckin' tame
Chorus I hate sports You're beatin' up on your friends
'Cos you're so insecure
You wanna be the toughest
But we all know for sure
You thrash because you know
You're gonna start another fight
But maybe when it's too late
You'll finally see the light

You're tough you fight you win so what 
You listen to the music
It's the coolest thing to do
But you don't ever listen
To what it says to you
Your boots don't make you bigger
Your pose is nothing new
Someday it's gonna happen
When we watch you fuckin' lose
I can't stand the way you treat girls
Aren't they just people too
Something for you to do
You like to fuck them
But their feeling don't mean shit to you
With your many ways
You've always got somethimg to prove

Open your eyes 'cuz it's time you see
Its's time we were all treated equally
Just when you think
A woman's only there to take to bed
You better think what's going on through her head
You were raised to think
A woman's job is slave to man
But I'm here to tell you different
You probably won't understand
Conditioning's got you fucked up
So you crave the upperhand
Just try to look within yourself
And change it if you can

There's no room for bruising egos
Man you rate supreme
But equality for humanity
Is what I dream
Girls are just the same as you
You're no smarteryou're no better
And only when you realize
We'll take it a step furtherI keep thinking each and every day
Have I really made a difference have I made things change
In all these years of growing up and standing strong
Has it made a single dent with all that is so wrong

But if I haven't done a thing for world affairs
At least I know I try and I'll show that I care
'Cause it's me that has to make an effort
Or what can I expect to change
That's where it starts in myself
Not just shifting all the blame
And as I'm growin' older I can see the changes
Yet history ain't history at all it seems
I try to keep my head held high eyes open wide
And growing keeps me learning yeah it keeps me free
Again we stand so silent
Act like things are oh so great
In love with thinking that
We've ended racial motivated hate
But the truth is clear just look around
It's worse than it was before
When another peace march triggers thought
A perfect reason we must raise war
Erase this begin to open up your narrow mind
I wish I could help dig it
All the years you've been brainwashed
I wish I could help
See America so proud and bold
Yet comin' out behind her voice
Conditioning so harsh and strong
That it smothers out what's left of choice
Can ya think back to the sixties
Not much has changed it's stayed the same
Seems like we blow our chances
To learn from life each time
Erase this begin to open up your narrow mind
I wish I could help dig it
All the years you've been brainwashed
I wish I could help
You see it every day
From prison schools to the assembly line
Another fans the flame
Discrimination segregation
Comes from every side
Which side of the fence do you stand on
Quick choose your side
When the wind blows where do you fall
Tell us if you canTired of hearing us moan and complain
Just 'cos you don't feel it
Doesn't mean there's no pain
Brought up then let down and run through the course
Able to fuck us and feel no remorse

This is a cry for the ones who can't fight
We're just the bad seeds who didn't turn out right
We'll get a chance and we'll break down the door
This is the angry the young and the poor
Turned on your own kicked the dirt in our face
We're stuck without money no working no pace
Just think what you'd do if you were in our place
Reality's waiting while you take up space


I know I've cried so many times by far I've had some doubts
And faces faces faces change but still I have to shout
Things have had me worried will I ever have to be alone
Then closed up doors push forward see a side I've never knownoh

Somebody somebody somebody help me scream
Somebody somebody somebody Help Me Scream
Someone there to drown the fire but a passion bonds a solid link
Heartbeat heartbeat heartbeat skipping faster as I sink
Is this a stay of dedication when it's time to bail out
Tell me is that what life is all aboutOhThrough troubled times news of hatred death and war
Find signs of an end but it may just seem to be okay
And I'm not alone when I say I feel enough to think
I know there's dark in all things so I find the light and struggle on

Lead me with a grip so tight I'll move ahead I'll break the path
I'll cross the line and still reach out
Wash my mind or stab my back but spirit stays my friend
You can not sway what's on the inside
Messin' around but if it feels like serious I fall to the ground
And I pick myself up so I can face th days
Learn on my own but I get so much from things I see these days
Vivid so clear I can't see why it's hard to understandDrugs make you a man
They help you understand
It's a cheap escape and it's nothin' great
But you do them when you can
Drugs make you turn on me
Drugs will not set you free
Your money buys you dope
Say you just can't cope
But friends are cheap when drugs can keep
A buzz inside your headYou're Out Of Touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're Out Of Touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're Out Of Touch
You're Out Of Touch
You're Out Of Touch
You're Out Of Touch
You're Out Of Touch
You're Out Of Touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're Out Of Touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're Out Of Touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're Out Of Touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're Out Of Touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're Out Of Touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
whoaohhhhh
WOW

You're Out Of Touch
You're Out Of Touch
You're Out Of Touch
You're Out Of Touch
You're Out Of TouchDaddy always told you do it like a man never get too friendly
ome won't understand friends have got you in on all those hard things that they've planned
All your life they told you never shed a tear 'cause boys don't crave affection
Boys ain't got no fear
But did they ever show you how to shut those feelings on then off again

And now you gotta hide yourself hide yourself away
Show you care and you might show the world that you're only gay
Crying is for babies for boys is it a sin
To be a caring sharing loving human one
Handshake show you're friendly but don't get caught
You gotta fight to prove you're not afraid fuck just to prove you're not
And all your life you play this game and it goes on and on and on and on
Now you've grown into a man proud as hell to be
It's now your turn to raise a son don't let him be one
And you can teach him all the things you were taught yourselfWhat do you mean when you say
We've changed our ways
Say we're just too political
Or we don't have much to say
The ones who criticize our reasons
Always seem to disagree
No matter what we do
It's them we just can't seem to please

Forgot the things we've said
We're only clones
Not cool enough to make it on our own
Judged by the elitist chosen few
Their labels aren't for me
Are they for you
You say some years ago our songs were fine
And our debut EP was just divine
But now a shadow haunts us through and through
And songs we wrote before you never knew
Tryin' to fucking change my mind just won't work  No way
I don't want your stagnant rules they're for the fools  Not me
Total antigovernment is all I plan to be
No selfproclaimed authority will put their claim to me

No authority Nobody's fool patsy
No authority I just wanna be 
Ain't a commie fuck the Nazis belong to no one's club
No fucking war in any way could make me grab a gun
All I wanna do is just be what I wanna be
But I can't see no future in this lame authority
I'll never understand the socalled patriot
Who hides behind the flag
And uses words like 'freedom' 'liberty'
Without the first clue as to what they mean
If it were up to them they'd forcefeed God and guns
Down every citizen
Misread the constitution very chance they get
To silence everyone everyone
I like where I live
I like my friends
I like my freedom
I like my band
But I'm not stupid
I don't believe
Or give much credit to your
Hate mentality
You cannot handle when somebody disagrees
Or tells you that you're wrong
Your education from the right wing media
Keep your views strong
I'm not afraid of people who don't
Look or talk a thing like me
Won't let the Bible be my manifesto
It won't help to set us free
I like where I live
I like my friends
I like my freedom
I like my band
But I'm not stupid
I don't believe
Or give much credit to your
Hate mentality
Don't tell me that I don't love this country
It doesn't matter if you doubt or hate me
I'll never buy into what you're shilling
I'd rather not have this debate
Montana
Candice babe
We got one
You know what it is when you hear that haa
I'ma take one shot for every time he look me dead in my face
Talking 'bout he ain't do it oh dear that's why I leave the bottle right here
One more shot for every bitch I had to put in her place
Talking crazy on my timeline this week throwing me shade see me in the street come catch my fade
I ain't even drunk as I wanna be yet
I don't wanna turn up dammit I need it

Trust me you don't really want that I'm just letting you know
You don't wanna see me when I'm in my zone
I ain't even drunk as I wanna be yet
I don't wanna turn up dammit I need it

But I beat it
Now I don't care 'bout nothing but a damn good time tonight

Mashed potato feel the groovy beat nowWell I'm nineteen years old
I don't know where I'm going yet
Or who I'm going to be
Maybe its because I'm indecisive
Or maybe just a little confused
I'm so scared of the future
And so hung up on the past
Someone tell me what's wrong and what's going on
Inside my fucked up head
Give me some sign
What is my point in being here
Tell me what's going on
With this world today
Maybe I need some time alone
So I can decide on my own
What is right for me
Thought I had it all figured out
I'd be a veterinarian and a parttime football star
But the novelty wore off so fast
That I was stuck at the beginning again
I'm still scared of the future
And still hung up on the past
Someone tell me is what I'm doing
Something I won't regretYou have this feeling inside and it makes you want to run and hide you're so scared You've got your hands against the wall you've never felt this way you've never felt so small
Too scared to say you love her too scared to let your feelings show you know she's leaving but it's better than to be let go
Another Will Hunting you think you know it all but this time you've never been so wrong you're only just a boy falling for some girl yet you haven't told her exactly how you feel
She can't remember you and the last time that you met she can't remember you you stupid fucking prick Will Hunting
Tell me what you have denied she feels the same as you inside
Too scared to say you love her too scared to let your feelings show you know she's leaving but it's better than to be let go
Another Will Hunting you think you know it all but this time you've never been so wrong you're only just a boy falling for some girl yet you haven't told her exactly how you feel Will HuntingI'd like to tell you what's on her mind her deceitful ways and all her lies but I don't know what she's gonna do next when you turn your head
What turned you onto her last night was it the look that she gave you or something that she said was it me where did she go
She's looking at you she's looking at me What did she say
Not much I wanted to hear not much she needed to say
What turned you onto her last night Was it the look that she gave you Or something that she said now she turns her head in shame and she is the one to blame I don't think she could waste my time she's looking at you she's looking at me what did she say where did she goI made the tears run down your face but I didn't mean it I wanted to say I'm sorry but I didn't know how to say it When you told me how much I meant to you why didn't I see it But I promise to never break your heart again
Because all I want is you with me and all I need is your heart By my side and all I want is your love because you're the only one that I think of
When you told me that I was wrong and you left me I knew I was the one to blame
Don't know what to say Now that I'm on my own way don't know how I should feel anymore
But I'm so blue without you being here with me I cry each time I hear your name your name
Because all I want is you with me and all I need is your heart By my side and all I want is your love because you're the only one that I think of When I'm aloneSince I've talked to you you're always on my mind it's like I've got a new best friend and I can't think of anything I'd rather do
Backing out because you've walked away backing out because it's hard to say words like that tend to bother me
You know I want to kiss you but I cannot find the time you know I want to miss you but your not mine
I'm losing my mind what would I say to you I don't even know your name and if I tried what would you say to me I don't even know your name but Id really like to know
Although I'm in despair I saw you standing there that's when I started to stare I couldn't hold out longer than I needed toStaring at the white on my walls and I know that your gone this time and I can't bring myself up to believe that you're really leaving me how will I live what will I do these are the things I think about because you left me here all by myself
It's easier to put down than to let go You're letting me down and I'm losing control
Stop letting me down
Every day these past three years that I ever had a doubt you told me not to worry because everything will always work out
But now I'm standing here without you and wondering what I could have done to keep you here and always be with me now I'm stuck with faded memories
It's easier to put down than to let go you're letting me down and I'm losing control I'm scared I don't know what to do
Stop letting me downWhat else could go wrong today another speeding ticket another fine more things that I can't pay My credit card is due my phone bill is two months late my homework's not done and I feel overwhelmed
But I'm thinking is your vision of my life keeping you awake at night because I don't want to let myself slip away
from your arms
I'm looking at you and nothing's changed not the same old shit of changing around Just to fit in the crowd Never looking for the trendy fad to follow
My credit card is due my phone bill is two months late my homework's not done And I feel overwhelmedI can't believe that you're with me am I living in my dreams and I can't see tell me are we together don't pinch me just in case because I don't want to wake up alone
Tell me what you want tell me what I've got to hold onto don't leave me here alone standing by the phone cause you won't call
Leaving on a Sunday train trying to catch you Am I too late because leaving you was my worst mistake And if I could you know I'd take it away I would change the past if I could I would hold you in my arms you know I would But leaving you and letting go Are two mistakes I know
Tell me what you want Tell me what I've got To hold onto Don't leave me here alone standing by the phone Cause you won't callWell it sho look good but it don't mean a thang to me
Yes it sho look good but it don't mean a thang to me
I've got a cool shakin' baby shake like a wildwood tree
You went away baby you got back a little too late
You went away baby you got back a little too late
I've got a cool shakin' baby shake like jello on a plate
When my baby walks you know she's fightin' below
Yeah when my baby walks you know she's fightin' below
Yes and when she stops flesh it shakes like jello
Well now shake little baby
Shake it for me
Yeah now shake little baby
Shake it for me
Yeah now shake a little baby
Shake like a wild wood tree
Now let it shake now let it shake
Now let it shake now let it shake
Let it shake a little baby
Shake like a wild wood treeDay by day night after night
Blinded by the neon lights
Hurry here hustlin' there
No one's got the time to spare
Money's tight nothin' free
Won't somebody come and rescue me
I am stranded caught in the crossfire
Stranded caught in the crossfire
Tooth for tooth eye for an eye
Sell your soul just to buy buy buy
Beggin' a dollar stealin' a dime
Come on can't you see that I
I am stranded caught in the crossfire
I am stranded caught in the crossfire
I need some kind of kindness
Some kind of sympathy oh no
We're stranded caught in the crossfire
Save the strong lose the weak
Never turning the other cheek
Trust nobody don't be no fool
Whatever happened to the golden rule
We got stranded caught in the crossfire
We got stranded caught in the crossfire
We got stranded caught in the crossfire
Stranded caught in the crossfire
Help meMary had a little lamb
His fleece was white as snow yeah
And everywhere the child went
That little lamb was sure to go now
He followed her to school one day
Which broke the teachers rule
But what a time did they have
That day at school
Tisket Tasket baby
A green and yellow basket
Sent a letter to by baby
And on my way I past it
Express myselfLook over herelook over there
Look all around me everywhere
Well it doesn't really matter
Which way i want to go
'Cause the night is a fallin'
And I'm a long long way from home
I am a long long way from home yes i am
Listen to this listen to that
People tryin' to tell me
Where it's at
But it really doesn't matter
I hear it all the time
And I'm standing at the crossroads
'bout to move on down the line
About to move on down the line
Well I've been over here been over there
Friends all around me everywhere
But it really doesn't matter
Which way i want to go
I'm a million miles from nowhere
And that's a long long way from home
And that's a long long way from home
Yeah a million miles from nowhere
And that's a long long way from home
And that's a long long way from homeYou better leave you better leave my little girl alone
You better leave you better leave my little girl alone
Lord before I get evil man and I go and do something wrong
You call my house just yesterday
I picked up the extension and I heard every word you say
Why don't you just go man and leave my little girl alone
Now before I get evil man and I go and do something wrong
You call my house all hours of the night
Let me tell you mister that's a sure sure way to start a fight
Why don't you just go on man and leave my little girl alone
Lord before I get evil man and I'm gonna do something wrongThe things that I used to do Lord I won't do no more
The things that I used to do Lord I won't do no more
I used to sit and hold your hand darlin' cry baby do not go
I used to search all night for you darlin'
Lord and my search would always end in vain
I used to search all night for you darlin'
Lord and my search would always end in vain
But I knew all the time darlin' that you was hid out wit' your other man
I'm goin' to send you back to your mama darlin'
Lord and I'm goin' back to my family too
I'm goin' to send you back to your mama darlin'
Lord and I'm goin' back to my family too
Nothin' I can do to please ya' darlin' ah I just can't get along with youRunnin' through this business of life
Raisin' sand if I'm needed to
Ain't so funny when things ain't feelin' right
Then daddy's hand helps to see me through
Sweet as sugar love won't wash away
Rain or shine it's always here to stay
All these years you and I spent together
All these winters couldn't stand the weather
Like a train that stops at every station
We all deal with trials and tribulations
Fear hangs the fellow that ties up his years
Entangled in yellow and cries all his tears
Changes come before we can go
Learn to see them before we're too old
Don't just take me for tryin' to be heavy
Understand it's time to get ready for the stormYou can't change it
Can't rearrange it
If time is all that we got
Then baby let's take it
Lovin' is a lovin'
The moment is aright
It's worth all the years in the past
Let's go one more night
Get away from the blind side of life
Honey I want you to be by my side
Me and my back door moves ain't no more
No more
Get away from the blind side of life
Honey I want you to be by my side
Me and my back door moves ain't no more
No more
Get away from the blind side of life
Honey I want you to be by my side
Me and my back door moves ain't no more
No more
Goodnight my darlin'
Another day has passed
Forget all those painful memories
Our love's gonna last
Come to me baby
Come to me one more time
It's time we got movin'
Time to move on
Let's slide out the door
Let's slide out the door
Ride our way home
Let's glide our way home
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
I've come back for moreHello there my old friend
Not so long ago it was till the end
We played outside in the pourin' rain
On our way up the road we started over again
You're livin' out dreams of you on top
My mind is achin' oh lord it won't stop
that's how it happened livin' life by the drop
Up and down the road in our worn out shoes
Talkin' 'bout good things and singin' the blues
You went your way and I stayed behind
We both knew it was just a matter or time
You're livin' out dreams of you on top
My mind is achin' oh lord it won't stop
that's how it happened life by the drop
No waste of time we're allowed today
Churnin' up the past there's no easier way
Times been between usa means to a end
God its good to be here walkin' together my friend
Livin' our dreams
My mind stoped achin'
that's how it happened livin' life by the dropA wall of denial is fallin' down
Whoa it's fallin' so hard down to the ground
Never knew something so strong could be washed away by tears
But this wall of denial was just built on fear
We've all had our demons from the garden of white lies
Dressed them amused them pullin' wool over our eyes
Go so far as to love them to keep from letting them go
All the while they we're killin' us but we couldn't let it show
No matter what the trouble we carry round inside
We're never safe from the truth but in the truth we can survive
When this wall of denial comes tumblin' down
Down to the ground
Simple things in life bring the greatest pleasure
A smile a kiss a little baby's laughter
It makes no difference if we run away in fear
The little things in life hold us so near
No matter what the trouble we carry round inside
Never safe from the truth but in the truth we can survive
When this wall of denial comes tumblin' down
Yeah this wall of denial must tumble down
Down to the groundWent down to Tin Pan Alley
See what was going on
Things was too hot down there
Couldn't stay very long
Hey hey hey hey Alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there
Livin' for their whiskey wine and gin
I heard a woman scream
Yeah and I peeped through the door
Some cat was workin' on Annie with a

Hey hey hey hey Alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there
Livin' for their whiskey wine and gin

Yeah and it was a 44
Somebody killed a crap shooter cause he didn't
Shake rattle and roll
Hey hey hey hey Alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there
Killin' for their whiskye wine and gin

With his hand on his gun

And I know just what to doWillie the wimp was buried today
They laid him to rest in a special way
Sent him off in the finest style
That casketmobile really drove 'em wild
Southside Chicago will think of him often
Talkin' 'bout Willie the wimp and his Cadillac coffin
Willie the wimp and his Cadillac coffin
That casket it looked like a fine Seville
He had a vanity license and a Cadillac grille
Willie was propped up in the driver's seat
He had diamonds on his fingers and a smile sweet
Fine red suit had the whole town talkin'
Willie the wimp and his Cadillac coffin
Yeah Willie the wimp and his Cadillac coffin
In his Cadillac to heaven he was wavin' the banner
He left like he lived in a lively manner
With ahundred dollar bills in his fingers tight
He had flowers for wheels and aflashin' headlights
He been wishin' for wings no way he was walkin'
Talkin' 'bout Willie the wimp and his Cadillac coffin
Yeah Willie the wimp and his Cadillac coffinYou're gonna miss me little baby the day that I'm gone
You're gonna miss me little darlin the day that I'm gone
Cause I'm leavin in the mornin won't be back at all
You have run me ragged baby It's your own fault you're on your own
You have run me ragged darlin It's your own fault you're on your own
You didn't want me no way baby till your other man was gone
You can try to get me back baby with all your tricks and charms
You can try to get me back baby with all your tricks and charms
But when all your games are over you'll be left with empty arms

You have run me ragged baby It's your own fault you're on your own
You have run me ragged darlin It's your own fault you're on your own
You didn't want me no way baby till your other man was goneI'm afraid of the way that I live my life
I'm afraid of the way I don't
I'm afraid of the things that I wanna do but I won't
I'm afraid of God I'm afraid to believe
And I'm afraid of all the loved ones that I've made leave
I'm afraid that my dog doesn't love me anymore
I'm afraid of the social laziness
That let Kitty Genovese die
And I'm afraid of the mob mentality
That makes otherwise normal people go blind
I'm afraid of the way that the world works
And I'm afraid of the words in my mouth works
I'm afraid that you all know that I am a pervert
But the big red bird that lives under the city
Doesn't give a damn about me and it dies every night
By burning alive
I'm afraid of my grandfather's cancer
And I'm afraid of my mom's dying arm
I'm afraid that I've somehow caused my family harm
I'm afraid that the ones I love won't have enough
I'm afraid that the ones I love won't have enough
It's harder to be yourself
Than it is to be anybody else
I wish I were a little less of a coward
But the big red bird that lives under the city
Doesn't give a damn about me and it dies every night
So I bought a knife
I am aliveThis place is taking all my self esteem
And everybody is afraid of me
And I can't make eyecontact with anyone I see
This place is taking all my self esteem
And everybody is afraid of me
And I'm afraid to go out in the streets
Reminders of my failures everywhere that I will be
Everybody is afraid of me
People freak me out
People make me scared
People make me so damn selfaware
I get bronchitis twice a year at least
My lungs aren't the way that they should be
And I smoke more than a motherfucking chimney
I declare war on my bodyI am white and I've got everything I need
No one clutches their purses when they're in a room alone with me
And I can drive through any neighborhood I please
At any hour and the police don't do a thing
So if I see a penny on the ground
I leave it alone or fucking flip it
I'm a straight white male in America
I've got all the luck I need
I'm a guy getting paid more than a girl with a degree
And I can walk in the streets after dark no one wants to rape me
And I can get a girl pregnant and just as easily flee
Just like my straight white male dad did to me
So if I see a penny on the ground
I leave it alone or fucking flip it
I'm a straight white male in America
I've got all the luck I need
I've got a pile of broken mirrors and I'm walking under ladders
And I'm spilling tons of salt because to me that doesn't matter
'Cause my skin and my gender and my orientation
Are the best things to have when you live in this nation
I recommend it highly
So if I see a penny on the ground
I leave it alone or fucking flip it
I'm a straight white male in America
I've got all the luck I need
Shit's gonna work out for me
I'm a straight white male in America
I've got all the luck I needI've had a bad day
I am ashamed
And I'm afraid
And I am drained of what was named
Self respect
If the bridge that I was driving over collapsed while I was driving over it
That may not be such a bad thing
I would finally meet my maker I could meet the great creator
And I'd punch him for teaching me how to say
And my body would be at the bottom of a lake in West Virginia
Instead of at the bottom of this bottle I drink
I don't have a drinking problem don't have a drinking solution
I don't think I ever learned to think
No one knows what it's like to be
Anybody but themselves
No one
No  hoo  one
No  hoo  one elseRejoice rejoice God's ears are stitches
Rejoice His eyes are big X's 
Rejoice His arms are burning witches
Rejoice His hands perform hexes

Rejoice because you're trying your best

i'm a bathroom wall freshly painted over
to cover up swastikas and the names of girls that we call sluts
i'm the total gym
i am the salad glove
i'm the slap chop
i'm the forever lazy
i am a boring and worthless thing and nobody should save me
i am the kool aid stains on the mouth of a kid
whose name is most likely kody
he had a juice box for breakfast and he carries a stick that he most likely found in the alley
kody doesn't have friends and his parents hate each other
he wants to find a better way to love his family
and after school he hangs out in the abandoned house behind the arby's
i'm the camera
that watches you
when you think you are awake

that keeps all their cocaine safe
and i'm the guy that eats at least 50 chicken wings

i'm a video store clerk and an angel of death
hi how are you my name is trevor
prepare to die
bad lieutenant 2 is the greatest movie everIn came the beingborn police
To take the newlyundeceased
I was the softened gaze upon a child of God
And the sky was full of teeth
Anticipating that sweet release
I was the little engine that could
I was a courtroom bombsniffing dog
And the blood collector collected blood
And the cannibals all sang

They found a weird calling card
In a puddle of body parts
Inside a bowl of angel hearts
That the children were eating
I was a vampirehunter
I was a pregnant mother
I was a tear shed for the ones that die believing
And the blood collector collected blood
And the cannibals all sang

Thunder dome broken home everybody dies alone
I wanna give a shout out to the innocent bystanding
And at the corner of my eye coming out from the teeth filled sky
With eyes as red as a dogs asshole when you see it shitting
I saw the children of God
As the walked all slovenly by
And the USB ports in their arms are bleeding
And the blood collector collected blood
And the cannibals all sang
I think I can I think I can I think I can I think I can
everything makes me bleed
the sparkle won't shine if you don't feed it light balls
deep in reality
i spend all my time getting strung out on life
it's not our world anymore
it's not our world anymore
your dead best friend is walking up the stairs
he's walking up the stairs with you
what is the wind saying
does it tell who isn't there
do the spirits haunt us
by blowing thorugh our hair
it's not our world anymore
it's not our world anymore
your dead best friend is walking up the stairs
he's walking up the stairs with you
it's not our world
and it never was
and that's not our problem
that's not our problem anymoreI walked into a room full of corpses
The room all smelled like flowers there were nikes on their feet
smile under the cloth
i gazed into the souls of all the horses
jumped off all the bridges in those wild western days
a spaceship made of death
do re me fa so la tee
do re and me
I gave into the needs of all my masters
man is the bastard is a brutal fucking band
they hate Thomas Lenz
I fell into a coffin full of orphans

there's a gerbil in the microwave a baseball bat in everyone
sharing kisses and building a bomb
we'll set it off like Microsoft in 94

McDonald's play place before the xbox
cake frosting sweet talking bedroom wall
covered in knives touching god burning shit
we'll make a wish and take a trip to future town like our daddy did
and we'll kill the neighbor kid who only wants to be our friend
his dad is dead enough that his new dad can cure the bends
we'll make a wish and take a trip to future town
feeling weird yet tasting sweet
its a top bottom rock smoking magic mask making it bleed
feeling sweet getting weird
now I can se the playgorund from the trees
and i can see the playgrond from the trees
and we'll show the neighbor kid what
what our love actually means
he's here from out of town and I heard he's got ADD
we'll climb the tallest branch with a rifle full of dreams
and we'll blow the little dickhead up to smitherines
Getting naked and playing with guns
there's a gerbil in the microwave a baseball bat in everyone
sharing kisses and building a bomb
we'll set it off like microsoft in 94
we'll set it off like Microsoft in 94 in our backyardSo what's the price fortune and fame
Friendship going down the drain
What becomes of those you meet
Stepping stones beneath your feet
You've got to reach the highest peak
Ambition isn't for the weak
Determined so you are inside
But who are those you push aside
People people people
Something just won't let you stop
Till you make it to the top
When you're there you'll soon forget
All the kindness you once met
So don't forget as you grow older
Keep on looking over your shoulder
Bitterness is all you'll find
Don't tread on those you leave behind
People people peopleI was minding my own business
Trying to do some thinkin'
You came up beside me and asked me
What was I drinkin'
Moments count to seconds
Count to minutes count to hours
Now we're back at my place
And we were kissin' in the shower ooooh
Put on the clothes on the table 
Together agreeing on your name 
It feels I'm yours
Hold up before this triangle's one on one
All I know there's the truth to be told 
All that gives isn't always gone 
See I went down on this roll before
I just wanna be sure so can we
 
Can we 
If it's alright if it's okay 

Can we 
Can we 
If it's alright if it's okay 
 yeah
I just want to make sure that if we do this
We don't regret it
Cause if the friction comes to static
Then we just might as well forget it
Cause nowadays I attempt to take a good look before I leap in
Cause I could stay all by myself from through you
Can't believe it no
Put on the clothes on the table 
Together agreeing in your name
It feels I'm yours
Hold up before this triangle's one on one
All I know there's the truth to be told
All that gives isn't always gone 
See I went down on this roll before
I just wanna be sure so can we
 
Can we 
If it's alright if it's ok 

Can we 
Can we 
If it's alright if it's ok 
 yeah
 don't think that I don't want you
 and that you don't drive me crazy
 there's just too many 'what if's
 there's way too many 'maybe's
Just one step back take a big breath
No pressure baby there's no stress
It feels so good
And I'm not sayin' we can't do this but can we
Sips on wine just a little bit 
Take a time just a little bit 
If it's alright if it's okay
Can we slow down just a little bit
Just relax just a little bit 
Just lay back just a little bit 
If it's alright if it's okay yeahI can't remember why we fell apart
From something that was so meant to be
Forever was the promise in our hearts
Now more and more I wonder where you are
Do I ever cross your mind anytime
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me
Do I ever cross your mind anytime
I miss you
Still have your picture in a frame
Hear your footsteps down the hall
I swear I hear your voice driving me insane
How I wish that you were the same
Do I ever cross your mind anytime
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me
Do I ever cross your mind anytime
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
Loneliness and heartache
Crying myself to sleep
Wondering 'bout tomorrow
Won't you come back to me
Come back to me
Do I ever cross your mind anytime
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me
Do I ever cross your mind anytime
I miss you
Do I ever cross your mind anytime
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me
Do I ever cross your mind anytime
I miss you
I miss youMmm Yeah Yeah
Look in my eyes take a good look
Tell me what you see
Because of you I'm only a fraction
Of the man I used to be
I didn't want to fall in love
I didn't really have the time
I didn't want to let you in my life
I wanted to run and hide
Now I don't want to live without you
Can't be without you
Ever since I let you in the door
Girl I don't want to sleep without you
Can't breathe without you
I think I found what I've been waiting for
What I been waiting for hmm
The smile on my face
Says I'm exactly at the place that I want to be
Girl you're like my fire
You're my one and only desire
You can have everything that you want from me
I didn't want to fall in love
I didn't really have the time
I didn't want to let you in my life
I wanted to run and hide
Now I don't want to live without you
Can't be without you
Ever since I let you in the door
Girl I don't want to sleep without you
Can't breathe without you
I think I found what I've been waiting for
Baby I'm going through it
I really don't know what you did
But I'm glad you did it
I never thought I would feel this way
But I'm so with it
All things are possible
And we're gonna fall together
Now I don't want to live without you
Can't be without you
Ever since I let you in the door
Girl I don't want to sleep without you
Can't breathe without you
I think I found what I've been waiting for
Now I don't want to live without you
Can't be without you
Ever since I let you in the door
Girl I don't want to sleep without you
Can't breathe without you
I think I found what I've been waiting for
Now I don't want to live without you
Can't be without you
Ever since I let you in the door
Girl I don't want to sleep without you
Can't breathe without you
I think I found what I've been waiting for
Now I don't want to live without you
Can't be without you
Ever since I let you in the door
Girl I don't want to sleep without you
Can't breathe without you
I think I found what I've been waiting for
I know what I've been waiting for and it's you
I know what I've been waiting for oohIf I traveled all around the world
I know what I would find
Someone half as smart
Someone half as sweet
Half as lovely and half as kind if I was the one
A kingdom with a wholesome wife to choose
It wouldn't even quite compare
To what I've got right here with you
So if I stumble just a bit trying to say what's on my mind
Please excuse me cause I never felt the way that I feel inside
It's possible
I may have finally have found my dream come true
There can never be another you
The stars are bright tonight
They know you are mine ooh mine
I knew that it would be alright when my other dreams fell through
And for this very night I've waited all my life
Standing straight and tall
I give my all to you
So please excuse me if I
Stumbled just a bit
Trying to say what's on my mind
Please excuse me cause I never felt the way that I feel inside
It's possibleIf I if I never show ya everything
Everything you need to see
And if I and if I never told ya
Just what you mean to me
And if you have and if you have a question
After all that we've been through
That you're the air that I breathe
Every song that I sing the reason for all I do
Remember what I'm telling you now
Baby it's you it's you oh yeah
You are all I ever wanted
I knew right from the start
You're all I've ever needed
You came and opened up my heart
And how'd you managed to do
The very thing so many others could not do
I have sunshine on a cloudy day
And it's all because of you oh
If I never show ya everything
Everything you need to see
And if I and if I never told ya
Just what you mean to me
And if and if and if you have a question
No question no question
After all that we've been through oh
You're the air that I breathe
You're every song that I sing
The reason for all I do
You are my only I never leave you lonely
There are so many words that I'd like to say
But they just might get in the way
So I gotta show you so that you can remember
Remember remember
When I'm wiping happy tears from your eyes
I know you'll remember remember
Happy mornings turn to happy days and happy nights
I know you'll remember remember
For those times that I might not be there
I know you'll remember remember
When our children say I love you mum and dad it's true
Yesterday today forever I know baby it's you ooh
It's you ooh oh it's youNever dropped a dime
Never played to lose
It's not really a lie if you're telling half the truth
All the other girls was just to pass the time
Til you let me get next to you 
Til you let me get next to you 
Never had a dream that ever came true
Never met a girl who was anything like you
Til I hear
I'm a hold my breathe til you let me get next to you
What do you say
Could you feel the same way about me
Can't you see
All I want is you all I need is you
Never had much luck mistakes I made a few
But I feel my luck has change if you tell me what to do
I'm not would you'd you expect if I come to bed
Would you let me get next to you
Would you let me get next to youSlow
Slow
Slow
Slow
Maybe it's the way you look tonight
Maybe it's the wine
Maybe it's just because it seems our very first time
Maybe you're wondering why I can't see
Get a hold of myself
Maybe 'cause I want you more than I've ever wanted anybody else
See
I'm about to make you mine tonight
'Cause I believe that we're a perfect fit
Baby if I move too fast I'd know myself
This will all be over too quick
I gotta take it slow oh oh
Take it slow
Take it slow
Slow
Maybe it was the moment that I felt your skin on my skin
Maybe it's because I never thought you'd let me in
And maybe it's the way you smell me be
The taste of your lips
Maybe it's because I was blinded by the shape of your hips
I'm about to make you mine tonight
'Cause I believe that we're a perfect fit
Baby if I move too fast I'd know myself
This will all be over too quick
I gotta take it slow oh oh
Take it slow
Take it slow
Slow
I gotta take it slow oh oh
Take it slow
Take it slow
Slow
So hard to keep my heart from racing
Didn't know you were such a freak
You got me hypnotize I'm wasted

Can't look into our eyes I'll lose it
Trying to keep control
If I'm gonna satisfy you girl I know
I gotta take it slow oh oh
Take it slow
Take it slow
Slow
I gotta take it slow oh oh
Take it slow
Take it slow
SlowNever Say Goodbye

When I see you I see me
Youre everywhere everywhere I want to be
When Im with you it feels so right
I want to be with you for the rest of my life
So come to me and take me as I am
For always starts right now

Youve given up your heart to me
Youre all I want
Its so hard to believe
That I cant stop from crying
When you walk down the aisle to me
Everyone will know that youre more than just a part of me
And we will be together
Forever we will never say goodbye

You got my heart you know that
Weve come to far and there is no turning back
This isnt fate its destiny
This is the way it was meant to be
So come to me take me as I am
For always starts right now
Chorus

If I give my best to you 
If you give your best to me 
The love we share today well share tomorrow
But there are no guarantees but if you feel like me
Then youll never be lonely again
Chorus
Never wanted to touch you
But it didn't work out that way
Never wanted to kiss you
Cause i knew that i feel this way
Never thought that i find somebody
Someone to share my dreams
Now all that really matters is you want to be with me

Just want to spend my time with you
Whenever we go whatever we do
I don't know that you know
I never felt the way i do
That's why i wish we could shout it
The dreams you dream they can come true
Just want the rest of my days to
End and begin with you

Never was willing to make promises
Promises are so hard to keep
Always knew that if feel in love
I fallen way too deep
Never believe in fairy tales
Fairy tales never come true
And all it feels like i am dreaming whenever i dream of you

Just want to spend my time with you
Whenever we go whatever we do
I don't know if you know what
I never felt the way i do
That's why i wish we could shout it
The dreams you dream they can come true
Just want the rest of my days to
End and begin with youI went to London
And every afternoon I had a spot of tea
But it was lonely there by myself I and me
Without love
So I went to Paris
The city of love all by myself
Hopin' to find somebody else
But there's no love for me
I've been around the world
To find another girl
But there's no love
There's no life without you
I went to Alaska
But this time of year it's too damn cold
It's not the kind of place you can go
Without love
So I went to Cairo
Athens and ended up in Rome
But then I realized I was too far from home
But there's no love for me
I've been around the world
To find another girl
But there's no love
There's no life without you
I check my message 
Hopin' you're missin' me today
And I didn't hear
And now I'm filled with misery and pain
So I went to Sydney
Down under is when 
Wastin' all the foolish time I spend
Without love
So I sent you flowers
Hopin' it was me you missed
I was thinkin' 'bout the first time we kissed
And if you still have love for me
I've been around the world
To find another girl
But there's no love
There's no life without youI can't remember why we fell apart
From something that was so meant to be
Forever was the promise in our hearts
Now more and more I wonder where you are
Do I ever cross your mind

Do you ever wake up reaching out for me
Do I ever cross your mind

I miss you
Still have your picture in a frame
I hear your footsteps down the hall
I swear I hear your voice driving me insane
How I wish that you would call to say
Do I ever cross your mind

Do you ever wake up reaching out for me
Do I ever cross your mind

I miss you I miss you I miss you
No more loneliness and heartache
No more crying myself to sleep
No more wondering about tomorrow
Won't you come back to me

Ooh woo ooo
Do I ever cross your mind

Do you ever wake up reaching out for me
Do I ever cross your mind

I miss you
Do I ever cross your mind

Do you ever wake up reaching out for me
Do I ever cross your mind

I miss youla la lla la la la la

You say you've seen too many things
that turn out to be too good to be true
Against your better judgment opened up your heart
'til you found the joke was on you
Looking out on the rest of our lives
If we're gonna be together or apart
About the only way I know how to come
is right straight from my heart
I want you now
I'll show you how
I can be the girl you need me to be
I've been around
but now I've found
that you're the only one for me
Say you'll never fall again
You won't subject yourself to such pain
If you give me half a chance I will
Never leave you standing out in the rain
But if you think that I could look you in your face and lie right through my teeth
then turn around and walk away
Cross my heart man I care for you and when I look into your eyes i
must say
I want you now
I'll show you how
I can be the girl you need me to be
I've been around
but now I've found
that you're the only one for me

Jehovah Emanuel
Upon a midnight clear

It's got to be His love
It must be His love
That brought You here
Because of His love that's why you're here
To give us hope for tomorrow
To take away the sorrow and fear
To wipe away the tears and love because of His love
Special one Who came to set all men free
Now all Heaven and earth will sing
Behold the newborn King
It's all because of His love
It must be love
Got to be His love
It could only be His love
That brought You here
Because of His love that's why you're here
To give us hope for tomorrow
To take away the sorrow and fear
To wipe away the tears and love because of His love
Oh close to my heart I hold the sleeping savior
He came to chase all the darkness away
If there might be things I don't understand
I'll just keep holding on to Your hand
Because of His love that's why you're here
To give us hope for tomorrow
To take away the sorrow and fear

Girl you're the on my mind always
Come feel my nights and my days
You make me so crazy

Now that you know I wanna

Oh yeah I'll be right there
Whenever you call me
I'll be there just call and I'll come running
I'll be there whenever you need me I'll be thereSome people think they've seen it
But once they get in between it
They find out that it's not the way
They hoped and they prayed it would be
The stories are so dramatic
The endings are sad and tragic
You'll find yourself so far away
A distance that love could not reach
It's easy to find someone
A Mr or Miss for right now
I'll promise you'll never leave
Someone you can't live without
Baby I believe it's you
I don't care what other people say or do
It only matters what we have is true
And I believe it's you oh baby I believe
Some people say they have it
We need to find what they have is havoc
Like waking from a dream
And every clich is true
Is it better to love somebody and lose
Than never to love somebody who
Doesn't feel like you do
Fairytales don't always come true
It's easy to find someone
A Mr or Miss for right now
I'll promise you'll never leave
Someone you can't live without
Baby I believe it's you
I don't care what other people say or do
It only matters what we have is true
And I believe it's you oh baby I believe
How do you think I find love
I wasn't sure till right now
I wasn't loud enough til you til you
Baby I believe it's you
I don't care what other people say or do
It only matters what we have is true
And I believe it's you oh baby I believe it's you
Baby I believe it's youTodo se siente tan diferente cuando estas aqu
Estas en mi mente estas en la gente que bello es vivir
And now that I found her don't wanna ever be alone
Tu me amas y este mundo se ve mejor
Amor la razn eres t
Puedes llenar todo el lugar de luz
Me haces volar hasta tu cielo azul
Mrame amor love la razn eres t
Voy despistado enamorado sin temor
No tengo prisa no hay otro lugar mejor
Trying to find the words but I don't know what to say
She loves me wouldn't have it any other way
Oh love look what you make me do
All of the things I swore that I'd never do
I didn't jbiw where this will lead me too
Look me now love
Me entrego a tu voz
Sin miedo en el corazn
Atrapado por tu emocin
Y la pasin de darte mi devocin
Abrazndome a tu piel
Todo va a estar muy bienUmm
Thinking 'bout all the times I let you down
Now both my feet are firmly planted on the ground
Hurting you was never in my plan
I was trying to be the man
I try to reach you
But you won't answer my call
And I don't blame ya
I never dreamed that you
You'd want nothing to do with me

I know it's true 
Instead of runnin' around
I should've been lovin' you

Instead of breaking your heart

And baby I'm so sorry for the things I put you through

Now I'm starring in the mirror at a fool
Who should been lovin' you

Who Shoulda been lovin' you

Oh

I'm thinking 'bout every time I lied unto your face
You saw right through me but still you gave me my space
Shouldn't have to tell a grown man what to do
I thought I was so damn cool
Baby I miss you but you're moving on with your life
And I can't stop you
I could have never surmised that I'd be standing all alone
With tears fallin' from my eyes

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
There's what you want
You walk away from me
This is not this is not the way it was supposed to be
Heaven knows how hard I prayed that Jesus could find a way
I would've have done I would've have said anything to make you stay
This is not like anything in my life that I've ever felt
What am I gonna do the first time I see you hooked up with somebody else
I think I might lose my mind
Inside my heart will be bleeding
That what I get
That's what I deserve
For being out there cheating

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ahIt's undeniable that we should be together
It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never
The basis is need to know if you don't know just how I feel

Since last time I saw your face
You've been keeping it tight and everything
Appears to be in its proper place
We laugh about back in '94
Reminiscing I hoping for a little old time sake
Can you stay Can you stay
Do you want me
Anything like I want you
Your body's calling
Tell me you can hear it too
I'm still crazy for you
What are we gonna do
Can you stay Stay
The night is young and
A familiar mood fills the air
I bought the wine and
Run my fingers through your hair
My mojo's working can you feel it
It's most time to reveal it
Let's fly away
What do you say
Do you want me
Anything like I want you
Your body's calling
Tell me you can hear it too
I'm still crazy for you
What are we gonna do
Can you stay Stay
Don't you worry 'bout a thing girl

But today is today stay

Your body's calling
Tell me you can hear it too

Midnight at the valet
He already knows gotta keep me up from
Heading out to security
Holding back the crowd as he opens the door
Give the fellas sipping haterade
To form a group and even get through the door
And it's OK 'cause it's the weekend
And it's a party for sure
All the shorty's are here tonight
Just left the shop and my wig is tight
I might not dance but baby I might
Everything's gonna be alright alright

There's a couple of friends up in here
The music's banging loud and clear
The temperature's rising just about to pop
There's so much going on I don't know where to start
I don't know where don't know where to start
I don't know where don't know where to start
Inside I see Lakers
And Clippers everybody says Ho
Cause they know I got pro rings and I handle that
Girl shake you from Go
Thank God it's Friday
And a fresh one just poured me a drink
Now I know what they meant
When they said it's good to be the shit

Just left the shop and my wig is tight
I might not dance but baby I might
Everything's gonna be alright

I don't know where don't know where to start

Tonight I broke my way in
I ain't getting here late
Look at all these fine ladies
I'm about to go blind
Look at all that dirt she's packin'
I'm about to blow a gasket
And I'm glad I brought some plastic
I can love her I can love her
I can regain my composure
I don't want to look like Rover
OK my eye contact is over
I might contact you this time
Cause tonight I'm living out my fantasy
My own little nasty world
Cause tonight I gotta find me a freak
My own little nasty girl

I don't know where don't know where to start Mmm yeah
Alright yeah

Just where I'm comin' from babe

And now I gotta face the fact that I
Shoulda been a better man
The kinda man that you needed

But I know I can't go back
'Cause now it's just too late

You ain't tryin' to hear what I'm sayin'
Maybe you done heard all of this before
Girl this ain't no game that I'm playin'
This may be the last chance I ever have
To talk to you before you go
So I gotta say I made a big mistake
Girl you know it's killin' me that I

Got to get back to them days
When you were mine
Ill do whatever I gotta do
To make you see
I can't live without you girl
Come back to me
Told you so many lies
Just to feed my selfishness and greed
Through all the fanfare
What was out there wasn't what I need
Found an old photograph
Brought back all the old memories
Wasted so much time without you
My baby I beep you
Try to reach you
Head over to your place
I get over
Someone else's Rover
Is parked up in my space
What have I done
I might have lost the one
I might be too late
Every time I get the machine I say

Oh I know there's still a place for me in your heart
And oh every moment I spend without you girl
Is tearing me apart
I know that this ain't the way that it was meant to be
Baby please forgive me girl
Come on back
No I didn't
No I didn't
First thing's first I'll interject
What's on your mind You seem upset
It's like I told you get a hold of yourself
It was good if that's alright
Twas no ordinary night until the dawn
But now I see that in hind sight
I really should've held back
I blame it on the moonlight no doubt
I swear on the star light
I really didn't mean to turn you out
I really didn't mean to turn you out
I didn't really mean to turn you out
I really didn't mean to turn you out
Now I know it sounds unkind
But let me help slow down your mind
Girl I assure you this wasn't in my plans
Just guess timing knew us best
But we run out there's nothing left except this song
And now I see that in hind sight
I really should've held back
I blame it on the moonlight no doubt
I swear on the star light
I really didn't mean to turn you out
I really didn't mean to turn you out
I really didn't mean to turn you out
I really didn't mean to turn you outGot your retweet got on your timeline

I don't think about it but maybe I do
Think about you
I made a few mistakes
But I can't remember the last time I kissed you
How much I miss you
I need you back in my life
I'm telling you that I can't get to sleep at all without you
I'm telling you that I can't go another day without you
I don't know what to say
This much is true
Whatever you want I'll do
Because I don't want to live without you
I say on my Facebook that I'm doing fine
Everyone knows it but that's just a lie
I gotta try 'cause
I made a big mistake
And I can't remember the last time I held you
I need to smell you
I need you back in my life
I'm telling you that I can't get to sleep at all without you
I'm telling you that I can't go another day without you
I don't know what to say
This much is true
Whatever you ask I'll do
Because I don't wanna live without you
Don't say it is over
There's some way
'Cause love will let me win
If there is half a chance girl it can never be too late
Girl nothing's the same without you
I'm telling you that I can't get to sleep at all without you
I'm telling you that I can't go another day without you
I don't know what to say
This much is true
Whatever you ask I'll do
Because I don't wanna live
Because I don't wanna live
Because I don't wanna live
Without youI'm so glad that we've had this time together
On my radio and right on my TV
There's no predicting the shortness of forever
And why the plan is always difficult to see
'Cause you were taken so unexpectedly
Another day another hour
Another chance to see you wasn't meant to be
Another moment another second
If I could tell you just how much you mean to me
I wish I could tell you just how much you mean to me
Have no choice but to wallow in my sorrow
For just a moment we are here and then we're gone
I guess I thought that we'd always have tomorrow
But the magic in your music lingers on
I just wish that you were here to sing along
Another day another hour
Another chance to see you wasn't meant to be
Another moment another second
If I could tell you just how much you mean to me
I wish I could tell you just how much you mean to me
So many questions but no answers why
I wished I had the chance to say goodbye
Another day another hour
Another chance to see you wasn't meant to be
Another moment another second
I would tell you just how much you meant to me
I would tell you just how much you mean to me
I wish I could tell you just how much you mean to meMy eyelids are getting very heavy
My will to stay away is getting weak
As I lay here tonight
Mama's turning out the light
I know that there is so much more to see
If I close my eyes I know that I'll be missing something
A shooting star or something good on the TV
Daddy don't be mad if you hear me crying
I'm only trying not to fall asleep
Whatever's going on outside my window
I'm not tall enough to look out there and see
When things go bump in the night and I'm terrified from fight
I thank God that I have Teddy lying next to me
If I close my eyes I know that I'll be missing something
A shooting star or something good on the TV
Daddy don't be mad if you hear me crying
I'm only trying not to fall asleepNobody really wants to be alone hey
I must stay this way for long on
I'm just trying my best to be honest and open
I'm still learning how yeah
I'm not saying that I'm here to bless
At some point it's got to be real
But I must confess that I'm clueless
Where I need to be this is hard for me
'Cause I'm gonna hold you
When I touch you it's the game I usually play
But when I feel you I wanna be with you
And I know just what to say
It will be the sweetest thing you ever heard
And despite of all the things I wanna do to you
This time I'm gonna be more than words
This time I'm gonna be more than words mm
Ready to let somebody get to know me yeah
Not just only skin to skin
But to alleviate the pressure pressure
Before we begin yeah
Could you be that special somebody yeah
'Cause I'm so alone to wait
I must confess that I'm clueless
Where I need to be this is hard for me
'Cause I'm gonna hold you
When I touch you it's the game I usually play
But when I feel you I wanna be with you
And I know just what to say
It will be the sweetest thing you ever heard
And despite of all the things I wanna do to you
This time I'm gonna be more than words
This time I'm gonna be more than words mm
Being close to you only makes it worse
If we rushing somebody will get hurt
It's truly extraordinary you might be the girl for me
Still I wanna hold you wanna touch you
Is the game I usually play
I wanna feel you I wanna be with you
And I know just what to say
It would be the sweetest thing you ever heard
And despite of all the things I wanna do to you
This time I'm gonna be more than words
This time I'm gonna be more than words mmGirl I know heard it all a thousand times before
You've been hurt wanting any times and it shows 
Baby nothing goes nothing it was nothing

This is how it all started
I asked you for your number
You took mine
Now I don't believe in destiny
But I think I see it right before my eyes
Oh I

Got me falling to pieces
Underneath the star light
See if we can keep it
Going til the sun light
And baby we were made for love
We were made for love
We took a left on Oceanica
Took the family sold it

Got to know each other

Going til the sun light
Baby we were made for love

Out of the dark love me right from the start
Wish you could feel that my heart is beating
If this is makebelieve you'll get it in return
I'm hoping that this night never ends
Baby now we're dancing in the moonlight
Got me falling to pieces
Underneath the star light
See if we can keep it
Going til the sun light
Baby we were made for love

Your lips keep me wanting more
Your thighs I can't wait to get between
So when I give it to you
Give it right back to me
Don't stop moving don't stop grooving with me
Don't stop moving don't stop grooving with me
Your kiss it's driving me insane
Your body an hourglass to shape
To my arms baby they are starving
Gonna put my loving where I
So you can see me coming
Don't stop moving don't stop grooving with me
Don't stop moving don't stop grooving with me
Girl you're on thinking love
Pulling to your love
Higher giving all you think
And come hit me on your love
Like a signal from up above
I can't even wanna wait
Baby girl you're a freak
Get down on my knees
Rub you when you say it's on
Till you tell me that it's right
Day and every night
Damn I love you more and move
Don't stop moving don't stop grooving with me
Don't stop moving don't stop grooving with me
Don't stop moving don't stop grooving with me

I was nothing then
Just the other day
And I couldn't help but smile
You're still beautiful
After all these years
And I'm so damn glad you're mine
Never lost a year
Girl you're still the flame
That's burning deep in my soul
So remarkable so incredible
The best I've ever known
When we kissed it's like Christmas
I still feel butterfly's
Every time we're together
Like the 4th of July
Ah oh 
Ah oh 
Ah oh 
Ah oh 
I'm still feeling you
You still got it
I can't get you out of my head
When I'm with you
There's no other place
That I'd rather be instead
Never lost a year
Girl you're still the flame
That's burning deep in my soul
So remarkable so incredible
The best I've ever known
When we kissed it's like Christmas
I still feel butterfly's
Every time we're together
Like the 4th of July

When we kissed it's like Christmas 
I still feel butterfly's 
Every time we're together 
Like the 4th of July Got your stretchy pants and that skin tight top
And the boot ends on your feet
And the devil and the angel on my shoulder agree
It's imperative that we meet
I play keys in the band and I sing a little
I'm a golf ball hidden machine
But baby I'm not jokin'
If you see me smoking
I'm on fire
And I hope that you feel the same
Whatever you want me to say I'll say it
In order to get you to stay
I've been hoping
That something can be arranged
Whatever you want me to say I'll say it
In order to get you to stay
And how 'bout your friend
Now we're dancing you're a beast
And you're smelling like strawberry peach
Then you dip it down
And you spin it around
'Cause you know I'm watching
And you back me up against the wall
Baby I'm not joking
If you see me smoking
I'm on fire
And I hope that you feel the same
Whatever you want me to say I'll say it
In order to get you to stay
I've been hoping
That something can be arranged
Whatever you want me to say I'll say it
In order to get you to stay

You know I'd rather be home with you
And honey doin' all the things wit cha
All the things that you like to do
Like washin' your hair an' paintin' your nails
All the things that your exman wouldn't do
Baby no I can't wait to get home to you

That's why baby
Everything I do
You know I do it for you
Everything I say is true
We been together so long
All the crazy things that we been through
Baby you know everything I do
I do them for you
You don't hear me through
I said everything I do
I do them for you
Now baby
You know it gets so difficult
To get out of bed with you
To go to my nine to five
It's the only place I feel alive wit cha
And to know that you're somewhere waitin' for me
I know that you're more than enough for me
I can't wait baby 'cause I know what you got for me

What kind of fool would I be
If I didn't give my all to you
And tell me
Where would I be if I couldn't lay next to you
But if I know that you're down for me
Then I know that everything is alright
And by the time I get home to you
I'm gonna lay a blockbuster on you tonight
The night is over
The DJ's 'bout to play a slow jam
I'm waitin' 'bout an hour
For this moment to dance with you
Do you want to dance with me too
We're hand in hand
We're cheek to cheek
Shoulder to shoulder
I reach around an' grab a little booty
And it feels so good

I just want to tell you
There's no place
I'd rather be
Than here with you
No need to worry
Just let the music take you over
It's startin' to feel like we're in a movie
Cause it feels so right
Can I drive you home tonight
And I think that this could be
The beginning of a good thing
I look into your eyes
And they tell me
That you feel like I do

Now that you and I are here together
Let's make the moment last forever
Ain't no way I might be foolin' around 
And oh
I know I might see you next to never
I'm glad I had this time with you tonight
If you ever had a grown man
Let me put you in a grown man business
If you ready for a grown man
Lay back and get this grown man business
If you ever had a grown man
Let me put you in a grown man business
If you ready for a grown man
B I'm about my grown man business
You tell me you like him 'Cause he's young but wild 
So you can't control him 'cause he's always out

And when he comes home he don't help with the bills or car note 
And although he got a young back he don't know about that real stroke

I bet you thought that age was just a number

But baby nowadays it makes me wonder
Why he let's you down at the wrong time

Plays you out like a small child


When the lies and games he runs on you get old 
And whenever you're ready for grown man love come on 
And when you decide that little boys finish girls 
Get back and get this grown man business girl 
If you're ready for a grown man
Lay back and get this grown man business
He's not really man enough to take care of home 
You need that security somebody sexy and grown 
He spends what he can but mama I gives all I have 
Just check my track record baby everything I do is first class

I bet you though that age was just a number

But baby nowadays it makes me wonder
He let's you down at the wrong time

Plays you out like a small child


I got all you need
So make up your mind
And have it the way you like
If you do choose me
I'll promise you you'll never go back

I'm right here
I'm right here
I'm right here
I'm right here
Ooh yeahEvery time that I'm with you girl
I can't believe you share my world
But it's real
And every time that I hold you close to me
Forever's all that I can see
How it feels
See I don't give a damn what my homies say
Don't matter anyway
See I never felt this way before
You leave a brother want more

I hate to see you go
Even though I know when you're comin' back
It's hard to breathe without you girl
And baby that's a fact
I know sometimes you have to leave
But I wish you could stay
Every time you go away
From the very first time that I touched you babe
Couldn't find the words to say you set me free
And every time that I kiss your lips
Nothin' ever tasted quite like this
Or got so deep
See I don't give a damn what my homies say
Don't matter anyway
See I never ever felt this way before
You always leave me want more

You're the sunshine of my day
You brighten up my night
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you say goodbye
Blessed be the day
She's the finest I've ever seen
Cut from the finest cloth of human being
An' bein' in her presence is like the first day of spring
N' whenever I'm in her arms I hear the angles sing
She moves She's so graceful
She commands respect
An' ooh she's so well put together
Like she's drawn by an architect
And all of the mistakes that I made before in my life
All fall by the wayside now that she's mine

I know she's more woman than I've ever seen
She says that she wants me
She says that she needs me
I know she's more woman than I'll ever need
She says that she love's me
She'll never leave me

Blessed by the way she handles herself
That's why I'm givin' my heart to her and no one else
She knows how to please me
She knows how when and where
She knows the right things to say
Let's me know she cares
She moves She's so graceful
She commands respect
An' ooh she's so well put together
Like she's drawn by an architect
And all of the mistakes that I made before in my life
All fall by the wayside now that she's mine


This women make my heart beat twice
When we makin' love in the car late night
Let my soul take flight
Apple of my eye let me take a bite
I want to know what you taste like
I ran through all of them
From the Marcia Brady type to Ben Stiller married
To a hood rat chick rockin' fatigues like the military
From the streets of killacali to the shores of tripoli
Dr Jays on the coture from Italy yo
I sip a kiss like a glass of wine
I take control in the bedroom 'cause that ass is mine
I'll count the freckles on ya face just to pass the time
You're serenaded by an ill rhyme mastermind
'Cause you're more than a lover there's more to
I had to get myself in order just in order to love ya
From head to toe I had to get you know
I usually don't get down like this but you special though
Thought about it no doubt about it
When you seek you find since I left you
Can't seem to get you off of my mind
I paid the cost now it appears I've lost the melody
Got monumental makin' up to do with you baby
Made some mistakes caused some heartbreak
You must be fed up I didn't mean it
When I was screamin' that I'd had enough
An' all the time that's passed from then to now
I can't get it right baby girl I need to see you tonight
'Cause I miss you want you need you back in my life
Got to get back to them days when you were mine
I'll do whatever I gotta do to make you see
I can't live without you girl come back to me
Come back to me
Told you so many lies just to feed my selfishness and greed
Through all the fanfare what was out there wasn't what I need
Found an old photograph brought back all the memories
Wasted so much time without you my baby
I beep you try to reach you head over to your place
I get over someone else's Rover is parked up in my space
What have I done I might have lost the one I might be too late
Every time I get the machine I say I say
I miss you want you need you back in my life
Got to get back to them days when you were mine
I'll do whatever I gotta do to make you see
I can't live without you girl come back to me
Oh I know there's still a place for me in your heart
And oh every moment I spend without you girl is tearing me apart
I know that this ain't the way that it was meant to be
Baby please forgive me girl come on back
'Cause I miss you want you need you back in my life
Got to get back to them days when you were mine
I'll do whatever I gotta do to make you see
I can't live without you girl come back to meVerse 1
In the garden spoke to His Father for the last time 
And Satan tried to trick Him
Said He didn't have to die
Jesus said Father not My will but Your will be done
The Messiah Jehovah He knew he was the one
Chorus
So it pleased them all to bruise Him
They beat Him in ways you never heard
And they kicked Him and they spit on Him
And He never said a mumblin word
But Lord forgive them Lord forgive them
For they know not what they do
And they nailed Him to the cross
And He died for me and you
Verse 2
To the disciples he said whom say ye that I am
Elijah the prophet from on high or am I the Son of man
Surely thou art The Christ
The Son of God who reigns supreme
he had to die that's why he came he came to set men free
Chorus
So it pleased them all to bruise him
They beat him in ways you never heard
And they kicked Hhim and they spit on Him
And He never said a mumblin word
But Lord forgive them Lord forgive them
For they know not what they do
And they nailed Him to the cross
And He died for me and you
Bridge
My Jesus paid the ultimate sacrifice
It was the reason why He came
The Lord said that He had to die
But He would surely rise again
Chorus
So it pleased them all to bruise him
They beat him in ways you never heard
And they kicked Hhim and they spit on Him
And He never said a mumblin word
But Lord forgive them Lord forgive them
For they know not what they do
And they nailed Him to the cross
And He died for me and youI've never been down for the kiss and tell
But I realized that you don't know me well
I'm talking about grown things
Don't let the words get in the way
I know that you heard all about my past
And all the relationships that didn't last
For we do what we're gonna do
There something I must get straight baby

See what we do here stays here
I'm telling you cause I want to make it clear
Its only cause I want you to have no fear
That baby what we do here stays here
And nobody has to know
What's good is if you meet me right after the show
I'm telling you cause I want to make it clear
That baby what we do here stays here
If you have any questions girl go on and ask
Right now our reputation is still in tact
Ten minutes till curtain call
Everything will be okay
I swear this has never happened once before
Chances are you won't get back once you're out that door
Your body is telling me yes you can believe me when I say

Its almost time to start the show
I don't want you to go
I want you stay I'll say it again
Cause I need you so
When we started down this crooked path
It was a point in time wasn't meant to be
I told you not not to fall in love with me
I hate I hate to leave you
Out out there on that limb
I think you might
You might as well stay with him Lord
Ooh they say the grass the grass is greener over yonder on the other side
I never told you that I loved you and if I did baby I lied
You wanna tell that it's over
Well I think you might wanna think again
Maybe you might might as well stay with him
'Cause you don't know you don't know
How much he loves you needs you soWhenever we're alone
I get beside myself
Can't wait 'til you get home
It's you and no one else
When I look into your eyes I see
This is more than just a dream
And everyday it grows
And I know
To be this is what's meant
The way I feel for you
There's no need to pretend
Just sorry it took so long
Well baby here's your song
I live for your laughter
Your happiness is all I'm after
Every time you go away
You take a little piece of me with you
I long to see the sunlight on your face
And you know
You're the only thing in my life I can't replace
When it feels this right it can't be wrong
Just sorry it took so long
Well baby here's your song
It might be hard for you to sing along
Well baby here's your songEvery mornin' runnin' late
Your boss is trying not to hate
You find it hard to concentrate
Thinkin' 'bout this good thing
I try my best to be your man
Use me girl if that's your plan
In the end you'll understand
Happiness is what I bring

Baby tell me who
Can someone do it better 
Tell me who
Whenever we're together it's like ooh 
You might start feelin' dizzy 
'Cause it's all over now
I keep you in the mood
It's easy girl 'cause I know what to do 
When the phone is ringin' don't disturb the grove 
You might start feelin' dizzy 
'Cause it's all over now
For your touch
Inside I yearn
To love you more
I want to learn
Your body is my first concern
Only when I'm breathin'
I'll get it 'till I hit it right
When it comes to makin' love I'm nice
You won't have to tell me twice
There's no way that you're leavin'

Ooh baby when the lights go down
I only wait to hear the sound of you
No holdin' back let it out
That there's no place you'd rather be right now
Ooh baby is ya feelin' good
Is it better than you thought it would
Are you comin' back I think you should
Over and over again
Mmmmm
Ohhhhh
Every time youre giving it up
You leave so unsatisfied
Pointing the finger
The feelings that linger leave you asking questions why
They talk a real good game
But they dont know what a tongue is for
They wine you and dine you
You let them inside you
It leaves you wanting more
Chorus
I did my post grad in sociology
So what I tell you might seem strange
The things you dont know about your physiology
You dont have to be ashamed
Let me show you how your pussy works
Since you didnt bring it to me first
I have lots of things to show you if youre ready to learn
Let me show you how your pussy works
Bet you didnt know that it could squirt
I have lots of things to show you if youre ready to learn
You got to let him know that its not going on
If hes not all about you and gets up without you
You dont need his ass around
Im gonna be your new best friend
For those times when youre by yourself
Im great in the shower Im battery powered
You can do it by yourself
Chorus
I got my post grad in sociology
So what I tell you might seem strange
The things you dont know about your physiology
You dont have to be ashamed
Let me show you how your pussy works
Since you didnt bring it to me first
I got lots of things to show you if youre ready to learn
Let me show you how that pussy works
Bet you didnt know that it could squirt
I have lots of things to show you if youre ready to learn
Have you ever said oh god I came
More than twice know that thatd be insane
We only just began and the best it will come
It will come
Chorus 
Let me show you how your pussy works
Since you didnt bring it to me first
I have lots of things to show you if youre ready to learn
Let me show you how your pussy works
Bet you didnt know that it could squirt
I have lots of things to show you if youre ready to learnOh yeah

Gonna drive you insane

Do I know more than we knew then
Or do we know less and we just pretend
Your brought out my heart and walked away
Your eyes tell me more than words could ever say

Should we take a chance
And dance the last dance
Should we spend the night
One last time
Caught up in this romance
Or maybe wait and see let it be
The way that it will be
Should we take a chance
And dance the last dance
How can I be wrong
When I feel the way I feel
How can I deny emotions that's so real
In the middle of the night
I call out your name
Do I ever cross your mind
Do you feel the same

Let me go come to me
Which way is the way it should be
This is so bittersweet
There's no way that we can love enough to show
If we take the chance
You could be the one
Did you say you had to leave
Can you stay the night with me
Is that the way it has to be
How I hate to see you go
But it's ok
Because I know
You could be the one
I waited for
You could be the one
That opens up the door
You could be the one
I run to
You could
Be the one
You could be the one
To share my nights
You could be the one
That brightens up my life
You could be the one
I run to
You could be the one
Every night I wish upon a star
Only wanna be with you
I just wanna be where u are
My body's callin' out your name
Girl tell me that you feel the same
You could be the one
I waited for
You could be the one
That opens up the door
You could be the one
I run to
You could
Be the one
I waited like forever
Thought I'd find you never
I just might be done
Think I've found the oneAre you lonely for me
Sunday night two weeks past
The last time I saw your face
Our separate ways we decided to go
Now I find my self
Sitting down thinking 'bout everything
To this place we've come to how
You used to be down
Memories of you
And could you be thinking 'bout me right now
Are you lonely for me

You shouldn't try to hide the way you feel inside
Are you lonely for me

Just let me make it right and stay with me tonight
Are you lonely for me

I won't believe we're through
Tell me what you want to do
Are you lonely for me

Hey
There's a good in your eye
That's a lie I wish we could back when we first met
How to forgive and forget
I wish that I could have you right here next to me
You're supposed to be in my arms
Through stormy weather safe from harm
Can we be down
Show me how I wish I could hear from you right now
Are you lonely for me

You shouldn't try to hide the way you feel inside
Are you lonely for me

Just let me make it right and stay with me tonight
Are you lonely for me

I won't believe we're through
Tell me what you want to do
Are you lonely for me

Hey
Lay it on the line
I won't waste your time
We can make it work
I know we'll be fine
Together we can start
Never be apart again
Are you lonely
Are you lonely for me

You shouldn't try to hide the way you feel inside
Are you lonely for me

Just let me make it right and stay with me tonight
Are you lonely for me

I won't believe we're through
Tell me what you want to do
Are you lonely for me

HeyWhen I'm all alone at night
I can hear the beating of your heart
I should tell you and I might
Before you tear me apart
You're all I ever think about
All I ever dream about
Can you read my mind
Can you read my mind
Oh when I look at you
I probably should go
Cause I wanna be with you
More than you'll ever know
Hmm for a taste of you
I could calm my desire
Baby you blow my mind
You light my fire oh
I want you 
Need you 
Can't live without you
When I'm all alone at night
I can hear the beating of your heart
I should tell you and I might
Before you tear me apart
You're all I ever think about
All I ever dream about
Can you read my mind
Can you read my mind
Is it the way I feel
The curiosity or the things you do
That brings out the lust in me
The thought of me and you drives me wild
Come close to me
Can you stay awhile
Hold you need you
Can't live without you
When I'm all alone at night
I can hear the beating of your heart
I should tell you and I might
Before you tear me apart
You're all I ever think about
All I ever dream about
Can you read my mind
Can you read my mind
When I'm all alone at night
I can hear the beating of your heart
I should tell you and I might
Before you tear me apart
You're all I ever think about
All I ever dream about
Can you read my mind
Can you read my mind
Yeah
Hold you need you
Can't live without you
When I'm all alone at night
I can hear the beating of your heart
I should tell you and I might
Before you tear me apart
You're all I ever think about
All I ever dream about
Can you read my mind
Can you read my mindAll you do is tell me lies
Can't you see I'm not surprised
That you think that I'm a fool
Hey
'Cause you think that no one sees
And you think you're playin' me
I just think that your confused
You're playin' you baby
You didn't think that I would catch you
You didn't know how I knew
You didn't think your girl would tell on you
You played yourself that way
She was your bestfriend in your eyes
But she told me the flip side
Guess she wanted in my life
If you would've seen her plan
Would've known I was the man
That she desired to have
You were too blind to see
You didn't think that I would catch you
You didn't know how I knew
You didn't think your girl would tell on you
You played yourself that way
I waited
Look enough for you to throw your cards
You played it
But playin'didn't get you very far
You didn't think that I would catch you
You didn't know how I knew
You didn't think your girl would tell on you
You played yourself that wayOoh ooh
Do you ever think about me
Do you ever cry yourself to sleep
In the middle of the night when you're awake
Are you calling out for me
Do you ever reminisce
I can't believe I'm acting like this
I know it's crazy
How I still can feel your kiss
It's been six months eight days twelve hours
Since you went away
I miss you so much and I don't know what to say
I should be over you
I should know better but it's just not the case
It's been six months eight days twelve hours
Since you went away
Do you ever ask about me
Do your friends still tell you what to do
Every time the phone rings
Do you wish it was me calling you
Do you still feel the same
Or has time put out the flame
I miss you
Is everything okay
It's hard enough just passing the time
When I can't seem to get you off my mind
And where is the good in goodbye
Tell me why tell me whyWhat's up girl
I need to talk to you for a minute
I can't keep playing myself like this
There's only one thing I wanna know
Should I stay or should I go
It's not my fault that you make yourself regret the past
But all I know is it makes me look bad
When I'm holding your hand and you see your friends you know
And they walk away laughing
Calling me a fool
 change the things you did before we met
Even though I didn't know you
 trust you even more girl I love you
So tell me what am I to do yeah
Don't know if we will last
Nothing we do can erase the past
Now can you tell me I don't know
Should I stay or let it go
Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be committed faithfully
But can you tell me I don't know
Should I stay or let it go
I think of the night that I made reservations just for two
But you gave your attention to someone across the room
I should have known right then that things weren't right
But I couldn't see it cause love had me so blind
 I be so secure in loving you
When everybody's calling me a fool
 on to broken promises from you
And I can't take no more from you yeah
Don't know if we will last
Nothing we do can erase the past
Now can you tell me I don't know
Should I stay or let it go
Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be committed faithfully
But can you tell me I don't know
Should I stay or let it go
Baby time and time again
I try to overlook the pain
And I think of losing all we had together
Girl if it takes me losing you
For happiness in me
I think that I might just have to let you go oh
Why you playing those games huh
I don't see how you'll do it when I walk out the door
Don't know if we will last
Nothing we do can erase the past
Now can you tell me I don't know
Should I stay or let it go
Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be committed faithfully
But can you tell me I don't know
Should I stay or let it go
Don't know if we will last
Nothing we do can erase the past
Now can you tell me I don't know
Should I stay or let it go
Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be committed faithfully
But can you tell me I don't know
Should I stay or let it go
Should I stay or should I goLove wandered inside
Stronger than you
Stronger than I
And now that it has begun
We cannot turn back
We can only turn into one
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch your fall
Whenever you call
And I'm truly inspired
Finding my soul 
There in your eyes 
And you
Have opened my heart 
And lifted me inside
By showing me yourself
Undisguised
And I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch your fall
Whenever you call
Oh
And I will breathe for you each day
Comfort you through all the pain
Gently kiss your fears away
You can turn to me and cry
Always understand that I
Give you all I am inside
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
And be the one to catch you fall
Whenever you call oh yes
Oh whenever you call whenever you callThinking back when we first met
I remember what you said
You said you'd never leave me
I let go of your hand
Built my castle in the sand
But now I'm reachin' out again
And I'm not letting go
Till you
Hold me
Mold me
Sometimes I feel so all alone
See I gotta find me way back home
So why don't you
Shape me
Make me
Wash me whiter than the snow
I gotta find my way
Back home
Master upon my knees i pray
I just want to be the clay
Put your arms around me
Place my life in your hands
Lord I know I'm just a man
I know you understand
This time I'm not letting go
Till you
Anoint me
Appoint me
Sometimes I feel so alone
See I gotta find my way back home
So why don't you
Chastise me
Baptize me
Wash me whiter than the snow
I gotta find my way
Cause I'm lost and alone
I've been wandering
Long enough to know
Humbly I search for you
And I'm not gonna rest
Till you
Choose me
Use me
Sometimes I feel so alone
I'm on my way back home
So why don't you
Direct me
Bless me
Wash me whiter then the snow
I'm on my way
Back homeI remember the day when
We first met
We both got caught in
The rain
And we were soaking wet
I looked in your eyes
You gave me a smile
You told me your name
You told me about
Your career
I told you about my hopes
My dreams my fears
We had some laughs
One month has past
Tonight can't you stay

Now that
The time is feeling just right
Candles burnin' turnin' out
The lights
Anticipate the feelin' of
Your skin
Shall we begin
Hit repeat and let the
Music play
Until the night turns
Into day
Openup your heart and let
Me in
Shall we begin
Over time
We've gotten closer
Than close
You're the one
I want to be with the most
Neither one of us was in
A rush
Agreeing to wait
Now I feel my patience
Running thin
Anticipating when you tell
Me when
The time is now
Tell me you'll stay
Thinkin' back in time
Someone said that love was blind
But they were wrong
You just choose not to see me
When it's right before your eyes
You'd rather compromise
Then give your all
Then it don't turn out
The way it's supposed to be
Time and time again you disappoint
When she believes
Just do your best
And give her what she needs
And

Cherish her love
Show her she's right where she belongs
Take care of her heart
Before she's gone
Cherish her love
It might be hard to conceive
You gotta see the forest
Despite the trees
Before it all burns down
Not tellin' ya nothing you don't know
But she'll let you have your fun
But when a woman's done when she's done
And then she'll go
Just when you're needin' her the most
Time and time again you disappoint
When she believes
Do all you can
Do give her what she needs

And if you care about the weather
Keep her safe and warm
Let nothing in between stand in your way
They say it's calm inside the eye of the storm
Together come whatever
Come what may
Just

I remember the way you used to touch me all the time
I told you how I was the luckiest man alive
And now I hear you showin' off your new boy
And frontin' like everything's alright
I'll be damned if I let you know that I still find it hard to sleep at night
Outside I'm smiling inside I'm crying
I just keep denying till I get over you

Outside I'm smiling inside I'm crying

I just keep denying till I get over you
Endless times I stayed up all night waiting for you to call
Lying to myself 'cause you weren't thinking 'bout me at all
My eyes are holding back the tears
My pride won't let you see me act a fool
'Cause I'll be damned if I let you know that I still feel something for you
Outside I'm smiling inside I'm crying

I just keep denying till I get over you

Outside I'm smiling inside I'm crying

I just keep denying till I get over you

Can't forget the way we touched

And the way we used to make love

Baby but now it's over and you're gone

Hey because I know I can't go on without you
Outside I'm smiling inside I'm crying

I just keep denying till I get over you
Outside I'm smiling inside I'm crying
I just keep denying till I get over you
Outside I'm smiling inside I'm crying
I just keep denying till I get over you
Outside I'm smiling inside I'm crying
I just keep denying till I get over you
Outside I'm smiling inside I'm crying
I just keep denying till I get over you
Outside I'm smiling inside I'm crying
I just keep denying till I get over youI was so lonely though there was so many symbols waiting
I'm so glad that this ain't that
Girl you're the reason I can make it through the long long day
And that's a fact
Baby I can't wait to get next to you
Oh I can't wait to wrap my arms around your body
Baby I can't help but to tell the truth
Oh it's so hard to wait till no one else is around
Gonna try to keep myself together till I find myself in you
Baby naw naw
Before they take you back to heaven gonna find myself in you
Naw naw
I hate to keep you waiting but there are some things that need my attention
Before I can get back to you
Anticipating my hands all over your body baby
You know I know just what to do
And baby I can't wait to get next to you
Oh I can't wait to wrap my arms around your body
Baby I can't help but to tell the truth
Oh it's so hard to wait till no one else is around
I'm gonna try to keep myself together till I find myself in you baby
Naw naw
Before they take you back to heaven gonna find myself in you
No no no no baby
The only place I want to be is right here with you
Loving you down and you you can take what you want from me
Long as you let me hang around
I'm gonna keep myself together till I find myself in you
Oh baby before they take you back to heaven gonna find myself in you
Oh baby gonna keep myself together till I find myself in you
Oh baby baby before they take you back to heaven gonna find myself in you
Listen listen ah baby babyI want you so
Try to say how I feel when I'm holding you close to me
But my temperature rises so I can hardly believe
That finally you came to me we made loneliness our enemy
Don't go don't you know
Feels so right and I can hold you longer
If you stay the night oh
The time is right and we will grow much stronger
If you stay the night tonight pretty baby
Stay the night
Words cannot express to you how I'm burning up deep inside
I took one look and I knew this was a feeling I couldn't fight
But now that you're here with me now that you're here with me hey
Let's make togetherness our destiny don't go
Feels so right and I can hold you longer
If you stay the night oh
The time is right and we will grow much stronger
If you stay the night tonight with me baby
At the start I thought it was too good
To be true but know I know that all along
It should have been me and you
At the start I thought it was too good
To be true but know I know that all along
It should have been me and you
Feels so right
If you stay the night
The time is right
If you stay the night
Feels so right and I can hold you longer
If you stay the night oh
The time is right and we will grow much stronger
If you stay the night
It feels so rightWhat are you calling me for
Thought it was over when you walked out the door
Reminded me of the pain that you caused in my heart
No I'm not missing you at all
No I'm not trying to make you feel small
But lady it cuts like a knife
That you think you can walk right back into my life So
You don't have to call
And we don't have a reason to talk
If you want something to say
Then start telling how you could hurt me that way
It was hell getting over you
Damn you for what you put me through
The curtain's closed goodbye the end
'Cause I don't think my heart will let me love you again
Everything you said was a lie
Right to my face couldn't understand why
How you could do me that way
Then walk back in my life
Where were you when I couldn't sleep
Where were you when I couldn't eat and
Where were you when I cried
There's no way I could let you back into my life
You don't have to call
And we don't have a reason to talk
If you want something to say
Then start telling how you could hurt me that way
It was hell getting over you
Damn you for what you put me through
The curtain's closed goodbye the end
'Cause I don't think my heart will let me love you again
No it can not find a way
I don't have nothing to say
Baby I gotta be real
Guess now you know how it feels
Why are you wasting my time
Guess I been crossin your mind
Can't let you back in my life This is goodbye
You don't have to call
And we don't have a reason to talk
If you want something to say
Then start telling how you could hurt me that way
It was hell getting over you
Damn you for what you put me through
The curtain's closed goodbye the end
'Cause I don't think my heart
You don't have to call
And we don't have a reason to talk
If you want something to say
Then start telling how you could hurt me that way
It was hell getting over you
Damn you for what you put me through
The curtain's closed goodbye the end
'Cause I don't think my heart will let me love you againForever was shorter than what I was thinkin'
Now all we have left is yesterday
I guess I wasn't what you wanted
Til you saw me turn and walk away
Be still you had me feelin' small when I'm six foot four
Fed up with you always comin' up short
Tired of all the games you play
Funny how now you've got so much to say
To say but you never
You never told me that you needed me
The way that your tellin' me now
You never told me that you missed me 'till you saw me breakin' up
You never told me that you loved me
Sorry for what I'm 'bout to say
But you're just a little to late
What did I do
What was I thinkin'
When I gave you my everything my life
I forgot about me and I stopped listenin'
Lookin' back I can finally see the light
You were happiest when I was all stressed out and losin' hair
Reachin' out for you and you didn't care
Tired of all the games you play
Funny how now you've got so much to say
To say but you never told
You never told me that you needed me
The way that your tellin' me now
You never told me that you missed me 'till you saw me breakin' out
You never told me that you loved me
Sorry for what I'm 'bout to say
But you're just a little to late
I know
But why couldn't you tell me when I needed to hear it before
I know
There's not much else to say
This is heartbreak heart tellin' why the hell would I want to try again
There's no way that we could still be friends 'cause you never you never told me
You never told me that you needed me 
The way that your tellin' me now 
You never told me that you missed me 'till you saw me breakin' out
You never told me that you loved me 
Sorry for what I'm 'bout to say
Sorry for what I'm 'bout to say
Sorry for what I'm 'bout to say
But you're just a little to late
Do do do do be do

Do do do do dodo do do be do
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Do do do do be do
Yeah yeah
Do do do do do be do
Oh no no no oh yeahMy shattered dreams and broken
Heart are mending on the shelf
I saw you holding hands standing so close to someone else
Now I sit all alone wishing all my feeling was gone
I'd give my best to you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry
One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mindthis time
Stop living a lie
I guess I'm down to one last cry
Cry
I was hereyou were there
Guess we never could agree
While the sun shines on you
I need some love to rain on me
Still I sit all alone
Wishing all my feelings were gone
Gotta get over you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry
One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mindthis time
Stop living a lie
I guess I'm down to one last cry
I know I gotta be strong
But 'round me
Life goes on and on and on and on
I'm gonna dry my eyes
Right after I have my one last cry
One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mindthis time
Stop living a lie
I guess I'm down to one last cryIt's 3 in the morning
I can't be dreaming
I' m wide awake
Watching you sleeping
And I realize
There's no place
That I'd rather be
I reach put to touch you
My heart starts to race
At the touch of your skin
There ain't no mistake and I'm lost in your eyes
I see all that I need to see
I'm feeling new things every time that I hold you
I'm telling you things
I would never have told you
I'm feeling my feet coming off
Off the ground
I wasn't looking
But look what I found
I wasn't so sure at the start
Now I wanna be there wherever you are
And I can't deny
How you got me feeling inside

If you think this is
As good as it gets
I swear you haven't seen nothing yet
I promise you I'm
Gonna love you
The rest of my life
My life
You turned a kiss when
No one could find the taste of your lips
I get so excited
I'm losing my mind
The way that
It's supposed to be
Mmm
Everything that we do
Is a thing worth repeating
I only think of you
When my heart is beating
I'm feeling my feet coming off
Off the ground
I wasn't looking
But look what I found
I wasn't so sure at the start
Now I wanna be there wherever you are
And I can't deny
How you got me feeling inside

You cannot show
Through the pain
I didn't know what I wanted
Thank you for changing my life
I wasn't so sure at the start
Now I wanna be there wherever you are
And I can't deny
How you got me feeling inside

It's 3 in the morning
I can't be dreaming
I' m wide awake
Watching you sleeping
And I realize
There's no place
That I'd rather beCan you hear me
I'm calling your name oh Lord
I can't go on this way
Will I make it another day
Oh Lord was I made just to beg and crawl
Who will catch me whenever I fall
Do I even matter at all
I am waiting here for you to answer my call
Can you see me
I'm down on my knees oh Lord
I'm lost and I'm so alone
Does your world have a heart of stone
Oh Lord am I destined to be what I've been
Never a thick and barely a thin
Where do I fit in
I am waiting here for you to answer my call
You say it won't be long
So I got to keep holding on
This world just so cold so cold so cold so cold
Oh Lord am I destined to be what I've been
Never a thick and barely a thin
Where do I fit in
I am waiting here for you to answer my call
I am waiting here for you to answer my call
Oh oh Lord when you gonna answer my call
It's Christmas give love 'till there's peace
'Til there's more then enough
It's Christmas give love
It's all about love
Yea yea yea
Today I saw a man on the street yea yea
He was cold he was tired
And there were no shoes on his feet yea yea
He said can you spare a dime
It won't take you much time
'Til I can get back up on my feet
I look to heaven and pray
Day after day
I'm just trying to get something to eat

And what about the woman
Who walks the night alone
With no place to sleep yea yea
And what about the child
With a broken heart
Through teary eyes that can't really see
All they need is a hand
Someone who understands
To listen to the cry that they make
Instead of walking on by
Take a look into their eyes
And help somebody find their way

Just open your heart
'Cause there's someone out there
Who's needing you now
A little love
Is something that can't be replaced
Put a smile on each face
Some how right now
On this holiday
I don't care what people say
Put their weight upon my shoulders

God so loved the world
That he gave his only son
Not just for me
Not just for you
For everyoneI have been so far away
Counting the time until today
So long I've waited for a chance
When I could spend some time with you
Just with you yes
You are growing so very fast
And I know I'm always the very last oh
To help you with a problem
To kiss your hurt if you should happen to fall down
Fall down
But when I'm gone
I need you here to carry on
My son I know you will be strong
Like a burning flame
You're my claim
That's why you've got my name
And just to show
Come what may I love you so
And there will come a day
When all that's mine is yours
To take good care of you and yours I swear
I swear
And this is my prayer
Oh yesThe first noel
The angels did say
Was to certain poor shepards
In fields as they lay
Oh in fields where they lay
They lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so very bleek
Noel noel noel noel
Born is the king of israel
As we celebrate the birthday of our lord
I won't let the true meaning be ignored
He came to give his life
For you and i
Noel noel noel noel
Born is the king of israelIs the feeling gone my love
Is it not as strong to you and I

Has the fire died my sweet
Don't I sweep you off your feet anymore baby

This is killing me baby it makes me wanna cry
The message you're sending me baby
Tears me up inside but tell me where

'Cause they no longer move
Inside of you my love baby

Have they gone away my sweet
Or am I buried somewhere deep inside of you my love

If I've done something wrong lady

Don't keep me hanging on baby
This is the place and timeHow do you know when's the right time to throw in the towel
What do you say when it's all said and done
Where do you go to sort out your feelings
When nothing is like it was
There's no easy way to break somebody's heart
I couldn't keep this thing from falling a part
But it doesn't mean that I don't love you
Oh no
And it doesn't mean that I won't miss you
Even though we're a part save a place in your heart for me
You'll always be my baby
Yeah mm
How do I look into your eyes and tell you it's over
What do I do if you break down and start to cry
Do I sell out and say the old cliche
It's not you that's me girl
What do I tell you if you ask me why
'Cause there's no easy way to break somebody's heart
I need to tell you but I don't have the heart
But it doesn't mean that I don't love you

And it doesn't mean that I won't miss you

Even though we're a part save a place in your heart for me
You'll always be my baby
I know it's hard right now but one day you'll see that
you'll find someone who'll love you like you need to be
And it's okay if you forget about me
Wherever you are in this world you'll always be my girl
But it doesn't mean that I don't love you
And it doesn't mean I don't miss you baby 
Even though we're a part save a place in your heart for me
But it doesn't mean that I don't love you
And it doesn't mean I don't miss you baby 
Even though we're a part save a place in your heart for meLullaby say goodnight
Close your eyes
Fall away to sleep
Eyes like mine don't you cry
'Cause tomorrow
There'll be much more to see

Don't you cry
Say goodnight and fall asleepWell the snow is beginning to fall
And the day of Thanksgiving has come and gone
Silver bells begin to ring
Hear little children sing
Silent Night was never just a song
Stockings are hung by the chimney with care
It's the most wonderful time of the year
Ice cream castles in the sky
There is happiness in their eyes
'Cause Christmas time is here
Ring a dingding Wrapping presents
Hearts reflect the fire's glow
I have you underneath the mistletoe
And all is fine
Fall down like rain upon me
Give me something I can feel
So then I'll know
Then I'll know this is for real
Stockings are hung by the chimney with care
It's the most wonderful time of the year
Ice cream castles in the sky
There is happiness in their eyes
'Cause Christmas time yes
Christmas time yes
Christmas time is hereI think I must be dreaming
That you are here with me
Must have died and gone to heaven
And it's all that I hoped it would be
When the eagles forget how to fly
When it's twenty below in July
And when violets turn red
And roses turn blue
I'll be still in love with you
I live to be around you
You take my breath away
Can't help but talk about you
Every night and day
When eagles forget how to fly
And it's twenty below in July
And when violets turn red
And roses turn blue
I'll be still in love with you
All I need is you
Need you just to hold me console me
Over and over I love you
When the eagles forget how to fly
And it's twenty below in July
And when violets turn red
And roses turn blue
I'll be still in love with you
Still in love with youMase and Brian McKnight
Bay Boy we dont' stop we rock we rock
YoI hit you the sound that the world can't take
Came straight out the gig playing two point eight
Near studded jewel flooded got to love it
First rap cat with an RB budget
Everyday on the TV me and PD
Girls see PD make their man break the CD
Why ya'll forever rowdy I'll be outie
Somewhere in Maui 'til I go back to Cali
Can't understand how he can treat you
The way that he does
Give me the chance to show you baby
You're better off with me
Oh so baby let me try I wanna make you smile
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
I'll never let you down I'll always be around
And you should be mine
If he don't love you right don't waste your time
If he don't treat you like you should then you should be mine
Why can't you see you should be happy
And I don't know why
You don't believe a man can love you
For the rest of your life
Oh so baby let me try I wanna make you smile
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
I'll never let you down I'll always be around
And you should be mine
If he don't love you right don't waste your time
If he don't treat you like you should then you should be mine
Yo what the deal honey insecure feeling funny
I know you're used to dealing with cats with real money
Also know you like Mase in alot of ways
But it's hard to go on when your lonely on the holidays
When you shop should you shop for two
Take you where the waters aqua blue
Let you fall back treat you like you all that
Under umbrellas with your shades and your straw hat
You ain't the one out clubbin' all day and all night
Just to save a fight you say what's right
And I know he ain't the cat that will stay in your life
Even though he gave you ice that'll make you his wife
How a man deserve you if he hurt you
How you give a woman 25 a curfew
Between me and you you ain't heard that from me
'Cause Mase ain't the player with the PHD
Girl come into my world
I'll love you the way that you need to be loved
No worries no more girl open the door
And don't waste your time
'Cause you should be mine
If he don't love you right don't waste your time
If he don't treat you like you should then you should be mineI can feel it in the air
Christmas time is coming
Family and friends have drawn near
Joy to the world
As heaven and nature sing
Hearts are filled with happiness and cheer
Oh grandma's in the kitchen
The aroma fills each room
Children making angels in the snow
And in the midst of silent night holy night and everything
There's one thing that I have come to know

There's no place like home for the holidays
Everybody's singing yeah yeah
There's no place like home for the holidays
Everybody's singing yeah yeah
Presents underneath the tree
I think there might be one for me
Little children everywhere
Their looking for reindeer in the air
I hear a knocking at the door
'Tis the season more and more
As we celebrate the birthday of our Lord
Oh grandma's in the kitchen
The aroma fills each room
Children making angels in the snow
In the midst of silent night holy night and everything
There's one thing that I have come to know

The old ones know the young ones know look at all the faces
It's good enough to make you cry
So good to be alive
Baby I saw you standing all alone
In the moonlight wishing as I may
And I might have just one night with you pretty mama
Showdown not ready but willing
To slow down 'cause I want to please you
I'll be around after the lovin' is through
But if we move too fast
Will we wake up bein' strangers
We've got time let it pass
'Cause how will we know
How far it will go will it end
I couldn't say I love you tomorrow
It's too big a chance to take
'Cause I'd be afraid you'd love me tomorrow
It's too big a move to make
We'd be makin' a big mistake
Don't get me wrong 'cause I want you
More than you know but let me get to know you
Make my heart show what my feelings show
Then I'll get closer to you
But I'm just so helpless against your touch
I'm defenseless you're makin' me weak
But I've got to be strong
If right by you I'm gonna do
But if we move too fast
Will we wake up bein' strangers
We've got time now let it pass
'Cause how will we know
How far it will go will it end
I couldn't say I love you tomorrow
It's too big a chance to take
'Cause I'd be afraid you'd love me tomorrow
It's too big a move to make
We'd be makin' a big mistake
But if we move too fast
Will we wake up bein' strangers
We've got time let it pass
'Cause how will we know
How far it will go will it end
I couldn't say I love you tomorrow
'Cause I'd be afraid you'd love me tomorrow
I wanna do right by you baby
It's too big a move to make
We'd be makin' a big mistake
I couldn't say I love you tomorrow
It's too big a chance to take
'Cause I'd be afraid you'd love me tomorrow
It's too big a move to make
We'd be makin' a big mistake yeah
I couldn't say I love you tomorrow
It's too big a move to make
'Cause I'd be afraid you'd love me tomorrow
Yeah baby it's too big a chance to take
We'd be makin' a big mistakeThey say it's a river that circles the earth
A beam of light shining to the edge of the universe
It conquers all it changes everything
They say it's a blessing they say it's a gift
They say it's a miracle
And I believe that it is
It conquers all but it's a mystery
Love breaks your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard
And it fades away so easily
In this world we've created
Where this place that we lived
In a blink of an eye the darkness slips in
Love lights the world
Unites the love that's for eternity
Love brakes the chain
Love aches for everyone of us
Love takes the tears of pain and it turns it in
To the beauty that remains
Look at this place
It was paradise but now it's dying
I'll brave the love
I'll take my chances that it's not too late
Love brakes your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard
And fades away so easily
Oh oh oh
Love brakes the chain
Love aches for everyone of us
Love takes the tears and the pain and turns it in
To the beauty that remainsBefore there was a you and me
My life was like a real bad dream
I wasn't trying to believe
In us
Now I can see the midnight sun
Somehow we need this to become one
And now it seems that I can't get
Enough I know now
I'm living the please you more
Whenever I walk out that door
I do what I have to do
'Till I can get back to you

When we touch
When your skin touches my skin
It's too much
When I'm near it seems like the time stops
My guard drops
And I didn't see it coming but
From somewhere right out of the blue
Girl I never meant to love you
But I do
Girl I never meant to love you
But I do
You didn't give us half a chance
And now we got a true romance
I think we found that so amazing love
It's like we're living in a dream
What's better than you and me
And now the whole wide world can see
Its love
I don't need much from myself
Just you and nobody else
Everything everything I do
I do it all for you

And I can see the sun begin to shine
I'll wipe all the tears from your eyes
'Till you forget back in the day
When somebody broke your heart
That's why you didn't want to start
Maybe your heart had to break to get you to here
And now you gotta know how much I need you
I promise you I'll never leave you
There never was a fool like a fool in love
I oughta know
But I can tell you one thing this fool's had enough
And it shows
When we were making love
I wonder who you were thinking of
Was it you and me or you and he
I gave my all to you and you walked all over me
Girl can't you see
I don't want to cry for love again
No more do or die for love again
I don't want to lie for love again
The only way to mend this broken heart
Is for me to say goodbye my love
Goodbye my love
There never was a moment I didn't need your love
I loved you so baby
Far too many lonely nights it hurt so much
Girl just go
When we were making love
I wonder who you were thinking of
Was it you and me or you and he
I gave my all to you and you walked all over me
Girl can't you see
I don't want to cry for love again
No more do or die for love again
I don't want to lie for love again
The only way to mend this broken heart
Is for me to say that I don't want you
I don't want to cry for love again
No more 'do or die for love' again
I don't want to lie for love again
The only way to mend this broken heart
Is for me to say goodbye my love
Goodbye my love
I'm goin' on goin' on with my life
Wipe my tears away I don't wanna cry
No more 'do or die' sorry I have to say
I'm goin' on gotta go on with my life
Wipe my tears away I don't wanna cry
No more 'do or die' sorry I have to say
Goodbye my love goodbye my love
Goodbye my love goodbye my love
Goodbye my loveEvery night I lie awake
Wishin' I could love you with all my heart can take
Tell me my love this time do you want me to stay
You say you're in need of a little love
And baby it's me you're thinking of
And nothing in this world could keep me away
Darlin' finally I've waited so long for you to come to me
Darlin' with each passing day there's nothing left to say
But I'm so glad we waited it was worth the wait so
Love me hold me don't hesitate
Let's celebrate our love together
Love me hold me don't hesitate
Let's celebrate our love together
Let's make it last forever for always
Can I open the shades You ask me why
So we can have the moon and the stars as our only light
Cherish the moment let's take our time
Passion flies across the room
The sweet aroma of true love in bloom
Softly I whisper Forever be mine
Oh now I see you're everything I dreamed of now it's reality
Oh love's so rare now it's ours to share
It's me for only you and only you for me so

Oh oh oh oh ah hey hey
I thought that love would conquer all
That nothing could break my fall
The moment you left my side oh baby
And now there's nothing left to say
Ever since you went away
I've been yearning for you deep inside
I can't believe that it's over
In my arms is where you belong
When I think about the love we shared
How did we go wrong
And how can I go on can I go on
Sometimes you can't let go
Of the love you thought was yours
Mine and yours
Will I ever get over cause I've come to know
That it's so hard to carry on
After the love is gone
After the love is gone
If I had only had a clue
That I'd end up losing you
I might of held on to my heart oh girl
Taking for granted you'd be mine
Till the end of time
Has torn my world apart
And I can't believe that it's over
In my arms is where you belong
When I think about the love we shared
How did we go wrong
And how can I go on can I go on
Sometimes you can't let go
Of the love you thought was yours
Mine and yours
Will I ever get over cause I've come to know
That it's so hard to carry on
After the love is gone
After the love is gone
I can't believe that it's over
In my arms is where you belong
When I think think about the love we shared
How did we go wrong
And how can I go on can I go on
Sometimes you can't let go
Of the love you thought was yours
Mine and yours
Will I ever get over cause I've come to know
That it's so hard to carry on
After the love is gone
After the love is gone
After the love is gone
I must go on
I gotta be strong
After the love is gone
I can't believe it but she's gone
But I gotta be strong
I gotta gotta gotta be gotta gotta gotta be
Gotta gotta gotta be strong
Oh after the love is goneDark is the night
I can weather the storm
Never say die
I've been down this road before
I'll never quit
I'll never lay down mm
See I promised myself that I'd never let me down

I'll never give up
Never give in
Never let a ray of doubt slip in
And if I fall
I'll never fail
I'll just get up and try again
Never lose hope
Never lose faith
There's much too much at stake
Upon myself I must depend
I'm not looking for place or show
I'm gonna win
No stopping now
There's still a ways to go oh
Someway somehow
Whatever it takes I know
I'll never quit no no
I'll never go down mm mm
I'll make sure they remember my name
A hundred years from now

When it's all said and done
My once in a lifetime will be back again
Now is the time
To take a stand
Here is my chance
That's why I

Bet she didn't tell you 'bout way back then
When she was my girl
She used to be my girl
See I know how you're feelin'

So calm down with the attitude
You just done met somebody new
You never know how much she's feelin' you
So be happy that you got her
Don't know much about you dude
Sorry I gotta break the news
She's still thinkin' 'bout me

She couldn't even hold her head up when y'all walked by

Sexy with talent built like a stallion

'Cause you might not be the only
So never leave her lonely

She's still thinkin' 'bout me

And I'll tell you why
She couldn't even hold her head up when y'all walked by
Well
Don't go hatin' on me
It's just a game
You want her you got her
Take her you got her
To me it's all the same

She used to be down with me
She used to be a freak for me
We used to hold hands
She used to understand
She used to get down with me
She used to take trips with me
She used to wiggle her hips for me
She used to lick her lips for me
She used to

She used to be my girl

The prophecy had been foretold
The One who had come to save our lives
Was born in the manger so low
And as sure as the stars are in the sky
Valleys low and mountains high
The newborn King was born
In Bethlehem tonight
Silent night holy night
Bethlehem tonight
Silent night holy night
Three kings brought gifts from far away
A boy came to play upon his drum
Skeptics saw truth and had nothing to say
The wonderful Savior had come
And as sure as the stars are in the sky
Valleys low and mountains high
The newborn King was born
In Bethlehem tonight
Silent night holy night
Bethlehem tonight
Silent night holy night
Behold our Redeemer from sin
There was no room in the inn
But still He left His throne on high
Shed His blood
To saved our lives our lives
In Bethlehem tonight
Silent night holy night
Silent night holy nightMaybe time and space will run and continue on like
Einstein said
And maybe time travel might even be possible but long
After we're dead
Maybe the sun revolves around the earth we don't
Think it do
Maybe serendipity brought you here to meet me to you
Maybe for a sudden my woman said this thing here can't
Possibly last
And maybe just maybe I want somethin' more from you
Than to get some ass
Maybe there are things you could put me through
Maybe we should do the things that lovers do
So let me love you with all that I've got
Let me love you from the top to the bottom from the
Bottom to the top
Let me hold you touch you tease you please you
Let me love you
Maybe April showers don't bring me flowers it's all
Been a lie
Maybe the sky ain't blue and maybe Tiger might lose
And babies don't cry
And maybe my felonious and trained weren't really that
Good
And maybe everyone that didn't place or show didn't
Give it all they could
Maybe foresight is tellin' you that this here thing
Can't last
And maybe just maybe I want somethin' more from you
Then to get some ass
Maybe there's some things I might put you through
Maybe we should do the things that lovers do
So let me love you with all that I've got
Let me love you from the top to the bottom from the
Bottom to the top
Let me hold you touch you tease you and please you
Let me love you

Could be as good as it gets
Maybe this is everything you need and more Everything

Been waitin' for
Maybe this is just the way that it should be Just the
Way that it should be

BabyOoh yeah yeah yeah
Today is your wedding day and that's a beautiful thing
No use in me going into the way things used to be
How I cared for you you cared for me and that wasn't that long ago
But I can't help but smile as you walk down the aisle
'Cause there's one thing I know heyhey
Every time you close your eyes at night
You know inside your heart that something ain't right
And things are not the way that you wish they could be
Even though you're with him I know you're thinkin' 'bout me
I know you're thinkin' 'bout me yeah
I know you think it's easier to lie to yourself
Even got yourself believing you're better off with somebody else
So you sacrifice for security
'Cause your impatient self didn't run away from me
And you settle for the first thing through the door
When you know what you want is me
Every time you close your eyes at night
You know inside your heart that something ain't right
And things are not the way that you wish they could be
Even though you're with him I know you're thinkin' 'bout me
I know you're thinkin' 'bout me yeah
I know he thinks you're crying 'cause it's the happiest you've ever known
But girl you'd just be lying 'cause what he doesn't know
You're strong for me you belong to me
And here's the one last chance for you to go
'Cause every time you close your eyes at night
You know inside your heart that something ain't right
And things are not the way that you wish they could be
Even though you're with him I know you're thinkin' 'bout me
It may not be tomorrow but there will come a day
But when you realize I hope it's not too late
'Cause things won't be the way that you wish they could be
Even though you're with him I know you're thinkin' 'bout me
I know you're thinkin' 'bout me
I know you're thinkin' 'bout me
I know you're thinkin' 'bout me
Yeah yeah yeahBeen around the world from A to Z
I wanna tell ya
I believe that you could very well complete me
I hang on every word you say
Think about you all night and day
It's not fate it's destiny
And if you feel the same way

Tell me how you feel and what you need
Tell me all the secrets that you keep
Tell me what you want
Call me and it's on tonight
Let me kiss all your tears away
Call me anytime of night or day
Tell me what you want
Call me and it's on tonight
You got a strong mind and you do your own thing
I'd never stop you
Don't have to be in control of everything
Together we are the gold
Together we're gold
And the dough won't ever be spent
Give it half a chance
I know we'll win
Girl if you feel the same way
The temperature between us two is steady climbing
The rhythm of our hearts suggest there's perfect timing
My intuition says tonight's the night
Everything's gonna be alright for sure
I'll be loving you more and more
The heart is beating through my chest
Can you feel it pounding
You whisper in my ear I like the way its sounding
Girl you know what happens next
I think its gonna be the best for sure
I'll be loving you more and moremore
I don't want this night to ever end
I don't know where I end and you begin
I wish I could make time suspend cause were doing fine
I've got your tiny hand in mine and it feels like heaven
Can't count how many times for 5 or 6 or 7
Girl you know what happens next
I think its gonna be the best for sure
Ill be loving you more and more
For sure ill be loving you more and more moreMoon needs the sun
Then the earth exists
Tall trees will grow
All because of mist
Then there comes life
Which is an awesome gift
Out of my eyes
Visions of you appear

Discovery
The world has yet to see
What you mean to me
A treasure unknown
To man
I'm so excited
Where do I begin
Oh
Notice how birds fly so care free
And pictures how they can bring back memories
And then there's the smile that can make someone's day
When my song was incomplete you filled the empty space

So now that I have seen
An angel spread its wings
Go on lay me down
I can die now
Ever since you came around
There's a new love in town
I'm not alone
Someone's at home
Yeah

Discovery
The world has yet to see
What you mean to me
Like a treasure unknown
To man
I'm so excited
Where do I begin
Oh

Oh
Where do I beginFor once in my life
I finally found what I was looking to find
When I first saw your eyes
I saw right through your heart
And climbed into your mind
I never thought I would ever have the thing
I believe other lover do
Now I do

Baby with you
All my life I've been waiting for you
And there ain't no mistaken it's true
I've been saving forever for you
Girl my only desire is you
Baby I'm so on fire for you
It's not hard to believe I love you
There's no war I can't fight
There's no river to wide
There's no mountain to high
With you by my side
From the moment I wake up till deep in the night
I never thought I would ever have the thing
I believe other lovers do
But now I do
Ah yeah

Mmm thinking back from yesterday
All the things I couldve said but didnt say to you
Shouldve begged you to stay
Heard that youve moved on
Heard youve been doing okay
Been thinking about you all the time
Do you ever reminisce
Do I be crossing your mind
All the tears and wasted time
Nothings been the same since you went away

Girl I know that I used to be your man
Used to have you here in the palm of my hand
I let you slip away
Just like grains of sand

When Im lying in my bed at night
Wish I was holdin you wish I was touchin you 
I cry myself to sleep at night
Wish I was kissin you instead of just missin you
Girl I keep holdin on 
Girl I keep holdin on
Girl I keep holdin on 
Girl I keep holdin on

Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Inside me theres so many questions why
 Is to live a lie
But in my heart now its just too late
Its just like staring up in the pouring rain
I refuse to believe that Ill never see you again
All thats going on inside my brain
That I cant seem to get it straight
'Cos

Girl I know that I used to be your man
Used to have you here in the palm of my hand
I let you slip away
Just like grains of sand

When Im lying in my bed at night
Wish I was holdin you wish I was touchin you 
I cry myself to sleep at night
Wish I was kissin you instead of just missin you
Girl I keep holdin on 
Girl I keep holdin on
Girl I keep holdin on 
Girl I keep holdin on
And If I ever hurt you
I didnt mean to treat you bad
I think about the good times that we had
And theres no way they can be gone
I be missin you missin you missin you
I be missin you missin you missin you
I be missin you missin you missin you
I be missin you missin you missin you
Missin you

When Im lying in my bed at night
Wish I was holdin you wish I was touchin you 
I cry myself to sleep at night
Wish I was kissin you instead of just missin you
Girl I keep holdin on 
Girl I keep holdin on
Girl I keep holdin on 
Girl I keep holdin on
When Im lying in my bed at night
Wish I was holdin you wish I was touchin you 
I cry myself to sleep at night
Wish I was kissin you instead of just missin you
Girl I keep holdin on 
Girl I keep holdin on
Girl I keep holdin on 
Girl I keep holdin onI can't remember why we fell apart
From something that was so meant to be
Forever was the promise in our hearts
Now more and more I wonder where you are
Do I ever cross your mind any time
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me
Do I ever cross your mind any time
I miss you
Still have your picture in a frame
Hear your footsteps down the hall
I swear I hear your voice driving me insane
How I wish that you would call to say
Do I ever cross your mind any time
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me
Do I ever cross your mind any time
I miss you I miss you
No more loneliness and heartache
No more crying myself to sleep
No more wondering about tomorrow
Won't you come back to me Come back to me
Do I ever cross your mind any time
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me
Do I ever cross your mind any time
Do I ever cross your mind any time
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me
Do I ever cross your mind any time
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss youfeaturing justin timberlake
When I was younger I never went too far
Held my feelings I never even wanted to start
Til when I met you I didn't know
What you were gonna do with my heart
When you talk I hang on every word you say
When you move you're like the breeze on a summer day
When you smile the sky turns from gray to blue
That's what you do
And you're the kind of girl I think of
And you're the kind of girl I dream about
My heart is telling me I need you in my world
In my world
Cause you're my kind of lady
You're my kind of girl
When I'm not with you wherever you are
BabyI'm counting the moments til I'm back in your arms
All I want is to have you here with me every night every day
When you talk I hang on every word you say
When you move you're like the breeze on a summer day
When you smile the sky turns from gray to blue
That's what you do
And you're the kind of girl I think of
And you're the kind of girl I dream about
My heart is telling me I need you in my world
My world
Cause you're my kind of lady
You're my kind of girl
Baby girl I need you here by my side
And If you're there everything will be alright
Cause this is the time for us 
Baby be mine 
And you're the kind of girl I think of 
And you're the kind of girl I dream about The kind of girl I dream about
My heart is telling me I need you in my world
Cause you're my kind of lady
You're my kind of girl
My kind of girl
My kind of girl
My kind of girl I I'll do anything that you want me to yeah
Easy ready willing overtime
Where does it stop where do you dare me to draw the line
Use the body now you want my soul
Oh forget about it no say no go

Yeah I I'll do anything that you want me to yeah
I'll do almost anything that you want me to yeah
But I can't go for that no no can do
I can't go for that no no can do
I can't go for that no no can do
I can't go for that can't go for that
Can't go for that can't go for that
I can't go for being twice as nice
I can't go on for just repeating the same old line
Use the body now you want my soul
Oh forget about it now say no go

Jump into you're eldy just like a swimming pool
Head first to quench for thirst but ended up the fool
Stay cool I wish that I could
But I can't so I shan't
Keep giving it all that I got to give
And that's a hell of a lot of a plan
Why can't you see that I'm the man
Our love could of been great
But a mistake is what you made
My cuisine you're dissin the plate
Never the giver just the taker
Take a listen to the the fact in fact
Can't go for that
There will never come a day
You'd ever hear me say
That I want and need to be without you
I want to give my all
Baby just hold me simply control me
'Cause your arms they keep away the lonelies
When I look into your eyes
Then I realize
That all I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life
'Cause I've never felt this way about lovin'
Never felt so good
Never felt this way about lovin'
It feels so good
How it takes my breath
Starts a burning in my chest
Make me weak when I think about you
Makes me want to give my all
Life wouldn't mean a thing
Not a happy song to sing
Just emptiness if I had to live without you
When I look into your eyes
Then I realize
That all I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life
'Cause I've never felt this way about lovin'
Never felt so good
Never felt this way about lovin'
It feels so good
'Cause I've never felt this way about lovin'
Never felt so good
Never felt this way about lovin'
It feels so good
'Cause I've never felt this way about lovin'
Never felt so good
Never felt this way about lovin'
It feels so goodI see that look in your eyes girl
I might cross the room that you're leading
And I can't deny that I want you
So I make my way up to you
No I see that ring on your finger
Telling me that I shouldn't linger
It's such a shame a disaster
That it has to be this way
But if it was cool
It would be me and you
Think of all the nasty things we could do
That would something but only
If it was cool but it ain't though
Tell me would he mind
If I kissed ya
Now he's at home watching ESPN
If I took you home would he miss you
But it don't' matter 'cause I don't get down that way
No if you were mine would you do this to me
While I'm at home watching reruns of Drag
Net with a bottle of Hennesey
Would you be ashamed when you saw
And what would you say
But if it was cool
It would be me and you
Think of all the nasty things we could do
That would something but only
If it was cool but it ain't though
Whoa so nice to meet
Oh I try to teach you the best I could
Like a true gentleman should
Girl I've gots to meet to him
He right there might just see it
I'll be around same bat time same bat channel
You know the station whoa
But if it was cool
It would be me and you
Think of all the nasty things we could do
That would something but only
If it was cool but it ain't though
If it was cool
If it was cool
If it was cool
That would something but only
If it was cool but it ain't though
We meet and everything was fine
We were so young everybody drove a Mercedes
We got so high so low wasn't so long ago
We coulda fell in love but your girl got in the mix
Made you sick drove you crazy
Then one day came out your face with a pack of lies
When other people get into your business
They should really shut the hell up and take five
And now you're sorry you say baby I'm sorry
I might be able to forgive you and forget but I dunno yetI remember how you used to wait by the phone
Counting every minute that I was gone
And you used to call me sweet things in the morning light
After you would hug me so tender
Each and every night
Lately you got so much to do
And your never at home
By the time I get to see you
You need your time alone
I've been too afraid to ask you
But I need to know

Is this the way love goes
Say it isn't so
Is this the way love goes
Right before my eyes
Wearing a disguise
I need to know
Is this the way love goes
Staring at a photograph of you and I inframed
When I blink my eyes you start to fade away
Oh I recall that day in fall and all the things you said
All of the promises that you never kept
Lately you got so much to do
And you're never at home
When I finally get to see you
You need you're time alone
I've been too afraid to ask you
But I need to know


Everybody needs to a love they can count on
I'm the kind of man who needs to know exactly where I stand
Stayin' up late at night I'm wondering
How we can make it right
Never gonna say goodbye
I'm crying
Find a way to make it rightThis is an instumental song with a few lines sung by brian and his wife julieSilent night holy night
All is calm all is bright
Round your Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night
Son of God love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at Thy birth
Jesus Lord at Thy birth
Silent night holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ the Saviour is bornLying alone in my room
Don't know what I'm gonna do
Trying to figure out if this is it this time
Just can't stop thinking 'bout the way
You make me feel inside
I just can't get you off my mind
No matter how hard I try
Could you be the one for me
Could we dance the night away
I wanna give you everything
Though I don't have much
Could you fall in love with me
Could you love me the rest of my life
Could you forever be the one for me this time
I walk around in a daze
The ice is melting from my heart
How can I ever know if you feel the same
Are you the sunshine that's begging me
To come in from the rain
Or have you come into my life
To turn around and take your love away
Could you be the one for me
Could we dance the night away
I wanna give you everything
Though I don't have much
Could you fall in love with me
Could you love me the rest of my life
Could you forever be the one for me this time
When I look into your eyes
They tell me that you're mine
But I keep asking myself
Could you be the one for me
Could we dance the night away
I wanna give you everything
Though I don't have much
Could you fall in love with me
And could you love me the rest of my life
Could you forever be the one for me this time
Could you forever be the one for me this timeTell me when was the last time
You were truly satisfied
And if I'm wrong then
Tell me that it wasn't with me

I can do it how you like it girl
Lights on is cool I can see it girl
Lights off is cool I can fee why girl
And I won't stop 'till you get enough
You know what I came to do
I know that you want me to
Relax let me set the mood
Break it down
Girl I can't wait much longer
I feel it comin' on stronger
I just can't take it no more
I want you I want you
You know what I came to do
I know that you want me to
Relax let me set the mood
Break it down
Girl I can't wait much longer
I feel it comin' on stronger
I just can't take it no more
I want you I want youUuuuum
Thinking 'bout all the times I let you down
Now both my feet are firmly planted on the ground
Hurting you was never in my plan
I was trying to be the man
I try to reach you
But you won't answer my call
And I don't blame ya
I never dreamed that you
you'd want nothing to do with me

I know it's true 
Instead of runnin' around
I should've been lovin' you

Instead of breaking your heart

And baby I'm so sorry for the things I put you through

Now I'm starring in the mirror at a fool
Who should been lovin' you

Who shoulda been lovin' you

Oooooooh

I'm thinking 'bout every time I lied unto your face
You saw right through me but still you gave me my space
Shouldn't have to tell a grown man what to do
I thought I was so damn cool
Baby I miss you but you're moving on with your life
And I can't stop you
I could have never surmised that I'd be standing all alone with tears fallin' from my eyes

Aaaaah aaaah aaaaah aaaah
Aaaaah aaaah aaaaah aaaah
There's what you want
You walk away from me
This is not this is not the way it was supposed to be
Heaven knows how hard I prayed that Jesus could find a way
I would've have done I would've have said anything to make you stay
This is not like anything in my life that I've ever felt
What am I gonna do the first time I see you hooked up with somebody else
I think I might lose my mind
Inside my heart will be bleeding
That what I get
That's what I deserve
For being out there cheating

Aaaaah aaaah aaaaah aaaah
Aaaaah aaaah aaaaah aaaah
Aaaaah aaaah aaaaah aaaah
Aaaaah aaaah aaaaah aaaahBaby
Tomorrow I'ma hafta fight
Leaving at first light
And all I can think of is you
Baby
I can hear you tryin not to cry
I'm afraid and I ain't gonna lie
I gotta do what I've been trained to do
I'm a little tired but I'm doin fine

All we see is red white and blue
Fighting for our red white and blue
Baby
How's our little baby girl
Does she know her daddy's half way round the world
Tell her she is my heart
Well
I've only seen her in a photograph
Don't know whether to cry or laugh
While I'm out here in the dark
I get so damn tired but I'm doin fine
Got my brothers back and he's watchin mine
Just keep prayin that we'll all make it through
I fight for what's right
And I fight for what is true
Mostly I'm fighting to get back to you
We don't see black
We don't see white
We don't see what we hafta do
All we see is red white and blue
Fighting for our red white and blue
I don't know the reasons why
Sometimes at night I sit and cry
It's hard to tell you what I'm goin through
What I'm goin through
When all we have is this telephone
On this telephone
Don't know when I'll be comin home
I just need you to keep praying that I do
I fight for what's right
And I fight for what is true
Mostly I'm fighting to get back to you
We don't see black
We don't see white
We don't see what we hafta do
All we see is red white and blue
All we see is red white and blue
Fighting for our red white and blue

Just save those playful thoughts for the children

Mary had a little baby
Born in bethlehem
Everytime the little baby cried
She rocked him in a weary land
Ain't that rockin' for the world
Ain't that rockin' for the world
Ain't that
Oh she rocked
Oh she rocked and rocked
She rocked him in a weary land
Rockingrocking
He was born in a lowly manager
'cause there was found no room in the inn
Everytime the little baby cried
She rocked him in a weary land
Ain't that rockin' for the world
Ain't that rockin' for the world
Ain't that
Oh she rocked
Oh she rocked and rocked
She rocked him in a weary
There were shepherds abiding in the field
Keeping watch o'er the flock by night
Unto you a babe was born this day
Said the angel of the lord to the shepherds in the field
Angels call him christ the lord
But I call my jesus king emmanuel
Everytime the little baby cried
She rocked him in a weary land
Ain't that rockin' for the world
Ain't that rockin' for the world
Ain't that
Oh she rocked
Oh she rocked and rocked
She rocked him in a wearyChristmas day is near
Family and friends all are here
I can't believe that you're still here with me
We've come through mountains of pain
Cloudy skies filled with rain
Can't wash away what Christmas joy will bring
The stockings have been hung
The carols have been sung
And we're standing underneath the mistletoe
I don't deserve you but still you continue to love me
Like every December we've known
Baby hold on to me
Don't let me go
Seems like thousands of presents are under the tree
Some for you and some for me
We watch the fire make its' glow
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
I reach for your hand
We touch I shiver
You extend your lips to me
Then I realize what Christmas really means
It's the joy inside my heart
And knowing that we'll never be apart
Only one thing in this world I know for sure
I don't deserve you but still you continue to love me
Like every December we've known
Baby hold on to me
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
What I'm gonna do
Is make the rest of my life
Like Christmas time with you
Don't let me go
Hold me love me give me all that you got
Tell me truly can I get in the right spot
For so long I've waited for you to come and love me
Don't waste my time 'cause I need you
To let me know if you want me too
Do the things to you  that no other can do
 I want you bad and I won't lie
And I can't deny that I want you tonight

I wonder what is it that turns me on
When I'm next to you
Can't figure out why I want you
Is it lust or love either one will do
'Cause I want you for myself and nobody else
 of you right now
'Cause it is on so unplug the phone
'Cause I want you to hold me

Oh baby drive me crazy put your arms round me baby
And hold me now that's what I want to do
Right now baby I want you to hold me
I can't believe that cupid was a liar
When he shot you and me
We were meant to be
How could I have let
You turn and walk away
Right out of my life
If I'm wrong or right
Can't take another sleepless night
Chorus
We could never ever be just friends
My heart is in my hands
And I'm ankle deep in sinking sand
I miss you so upon my knees I bend
And pray someday you'll want me back again
I pray someday you'll love me once again
Oh yeah
Got to find a way to get
Your head back on my shoulder
Holdin' back the tears
The future's so unclear
I never meant to hurt
The one I love the most
If I could just rewind the hands of time
To the days I had you here
Chorus
Doctor can't you give me something
Something to help me ease the pain
Can I come in from the rain
Chorus
We could never ever be just friends
My heart is in your hands
And I'm ankle deep in sinking sand
I miss you so upon my knees I bend
And pray someday you'll want me back again
And pray someday you'll want me back again
I pray someday you'll love me once againGod rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
Oh tiding of comfort and joy
From God our heavenly father
The blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The son of God by name
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Fear not said the angel
Let nothing you affright
This day is born a savior
Of the pure virgin bright
To free all those who trust in him
From Satan's power and might
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear savior lay
They found him in the manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His mother Mary kneeled down
And to the lord did pray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joyVerse 1
Lying alone in my room
Don't know what I'm gonna do
Trying to figure out
If this is it this time
Just can't stop thinking
About the way you make me feel inside
I just can't get you off my mind
No matter how hard I try
Chorus
Could you be the one for me
Could we dance the night away
I want to give you everything
Though I don't have much
Could you fall in love with me
Could you love me the rest of my life
Could you forever be
The one for me this time
Verse 2
I walk around in a daze
The ice is melting from my heart
Can I ever know if you feel the same
Are you the sunshine that's begging me
Come in from the rain
Or have you come into my life
To turn around and take your love away
Chorus
Bridge
When I look into your eyes

They tell me that you're mine
but I keep asking myself
Chorus
Could you forever be
The one for me

That turned out to be too good to be true
Against your better judgment opened up your heart
Till you found the joke was on you
Looking out on the rest of our lives
If we're gonna be together or apart
About the only way that I know how to come
Is right straight from my heart
I want you now I'll show you how
I can be the man you need me to be
I've been around but now I've found
That you're the only one for me
You say you'll never fall again
You won't subject yourself to such pain
But if you give me half a chance I'll win
I'll never leave you standing out in the rain
But if you think that I can look you in the face
And lie right through my teeth
Then turn around and walk away
But cross my heart girl I care for you
When I look into your eyes and I say
I want you now I'll show you how
I can be the man you need me to be
I've been around but now I've found
That you're the only one for me
I need you so I can't let go
Gonna be all that I can be
I want you still I always will
'Cause you're the only one for me
I want you now I'll show you how
I can be the man you need me to be
I've been around but now I've found
That you're the only one for me
I need you so I can't let go
I'm gonna be all that I can be
I want you still I always will
'Cause you're the only one for meCould it be that I can't stand to be alone
This long distance has us livin' on the phone
Ever since you've been away
I just can't get through a day
Girl I just can't wait to have you
Here at home oh baby
Every time we say goodbye boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye boo
I don't want you to go
Sometimes I only get to see you for a day
If that's all I can get then that's what I'll take
'Cause soon I know the day will come
When you and I will be as one
But right now this thing gets so hard
For me to say oh baby
Every time we say goodbye boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye boo

I don't want you to go

Every time we say goodbye boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye boo
I don't want you to goI remember days and nights were never cold
Had you in my life I had you there to hold
And I remember love warm as a summer day
But I lost you
And I lost my way
Now I'm in the rain
Begging you please please
Baby won't you show me the way back to your heart
Let me see a sign to know if I'm close or far
Lead me back to the road
That leads back to your arms
Every night another lonely street
I walk down alone
Searching for a light
Your light to lead me home
Leave a candle in the window
And let it shine for me
Take my hand and take these tears away
I can't take the pain
I'm on my knees begging you please
Chorus
Take my hand
Take me in your arms
I'm out in the dark
Down on my knees begging you please
ChorusHey ho hey ho 
Oh oh gidyup
All of these flowers
For this friend of ours it's such a shame
All of these people
All of them equally feel the same
There's silence and weeping
Looks like he's sleeping the children say
They say he was ready I hope he was ready
Is the prayer I'm praying
When Gabriel begins to blow
Victory shall be mine
When the horses get ready to go
Angels won't leave me behind

I'm gonna be got to be ready
When the chariot comes

I'm gonna be got to be ready
When the chariot comes

Over the prairie
The pallbearers carry and lay him to rest
Satan's a cheater Christ is the teacher
And life's the test
Oh Lord take me higher
Never liked fire I can't stay here
I gotta get ready gotta get ready
Time has drawn near
When Gabriel begins to blow
Victory shall be mine
When the horses get ready to go
The angels won't leave me behind

As I lay me down to sleep
I pray my soul you keep
If I die before I wake
I pray my soul you'll take
'Cause I gotta be gotta be ready when Jesus comes
When that chariot comes
Got to be  got to be ready when the chariot comes

Said I've got to be got to be ready
When the chariot comesI can't remember
The last time I felt this way
You're keeping a smile on my face
You know exactly how I tick
Every time I light the wick
Seems like you're ready to explode
I want you to know
You got the bomb
Just can't get enough
You got the bomb bomb
Just keep on blowin' me up
You got the bomb bomb
Just can't get enough
You got the bomb bomb blowin' me up
I recall
The first time I kissed your lips


Whenever you want me girl I'm there
Whatever the time girl I don't care
I got no place to go
Baby I know
You got the bomb
Just can't get enough
You got the bomb bomb
Just keep on blowin' me up
You got the bomb bomb
Just can't get enough
You got the bomb bomb blowin' me upI want you for myself

One more time
End And Beginning With You

Never wanted to touch you
But it didn't turn out that way
Never wanted to kiss you
Cause I knew that Id feel this way
Never thought that Id find somebody
Someone to share my dreams
Now all that really matters is you want to be with me

Just want to spend my time with you
Whenever we go whatever we do
I don't know if you know but
Ive never felt the way I do
That's why I want to scream and shout it
The dreams you dream they can come true
Just want the rest of my days to
End and begin with you

Never was willing to make promises
Promises are so hard to keep
Always knew if I fell in love
Id fall in way too deep
Never believed in fairy tales
Fairy tales never come true
It always feels like I am dreaming whenever I look at you

Once you get started open up your heart and
You won't remember the things you say youd never do
And before you know it
Youre totally devoted
And all your fondest dreams will come true

Just want them to end and begin with you
To end and begin with youSir I'm a bit nervous
'Bout being here today
Still not real sure what I'm going to say
So bear with me please
If I take up too much of your time
See in this box is a ring for your oldest
She's my everything and all that I know is
It would be such a relief if I knew that we were on the same side
Very soon I'm hoping that I
Can marry your daughter
And make her my wife
I want her to be the only girl that I love for the rest of my life
And give her the best of me 'till the day that I die yeah
I'm gonna marry your princess
And make her my queen
She'll be the most beautiful bride that I've ever seen
Can't wait to smile
When she walks down the aisle
On the arm of her father
On the day that I marry your daughter
She's been here every step
Since the day that we met 
So don't you ever worry about me ever treating her bad
I've got most of my vows done so far 
And till death do us part
There's no doubt in my mind
It's time
I'm ready to start
I swear to you with all of my heart
I'm gonna marry your daughter
And make her my wife
I want her to be the only girl that I love for the rest of my life
And give her the best of me 'till the day that I die yeah
I'm gonna marry your princess
And make her my queen
She'll be the most beautiful bride that I've ever seen
I can't wait to smile
As she walks down the aisle
On the arm of her father
On the day that I marry your daughter
The first time I saw her
I swear I knew that I'd say I do
I'm gonna marry your daughter
And make her my wife
I want her to be the only girl that I love for the rest of my life
And give her the best of me 'till the day that I die
I'm gonna marry your princess
And make her my queen
She'll be the most beautiful bride that I've ever seen
I can't wait to smile
As she walks down the aisle
On the arm of her father
On the day that I marry your daughterI see it clearly
Even if I was blind
You've got me really
Going out of my mind
Things that you whisper
Soft in my ear
Words I've been wanting
For so long to hear
I don't know if it's real
But I know how I feel it's
So crazy so amazing
You can take me now
Got my back against the wall
Feels like I'm standing ten feet tall
On the ledge close to call
If you push I just might fall
I just might fall
I just might fall
I just might fall
I just might fall
When you're not near me
I long for your touch
When you're right here with me
I can't get enough
The way I used to think girl
Will never be the same
'Cause you reside deeply
In my heart and my brain
I don't know if it's real
But I know how I feel it's
So amazing so crazy
I can't shake you now
Got my back against the wall
Feels like I'm standing ten feet tall
On the ledge close to call
If you push I just might fall
I just might fall
I just might fall
I just might fall
I just might fall
Each and every moment
Without you is alone
Thinking about you
And I know nothing will never be the same
Waited a lifetime
To find you
Just want to stay right beside you
I won't let it slip away
Got my back against the wall
Feels like I'm standing ten feet tall
On the ledge too close to call
But if you push I just might fall
I just might fall
I just might fall
I just might fall
I just might fallI used to hang out all night
Ladies on the left and and the right
They used to call me Mr Shady down low undercover

I didn't give a damn what I said
As long as they awoke in my bed
I was gonna get it one way or the other

I was just as fast as I could be
Didn't want nobody changing me
I'd go running from lover to lover
Then you walked in my life right on time
Not a penny short of a dime
And baby I'm beginning to discover

This must be love
It must be love yeah
Cause tell me what is love
If this ain't love
This must be love
It's gotta be love yeah
Cause tell me what is love
If this ain't love
It's all because of you
I'm doing all the things I would not do
I've come so far I don't think I'll recover
Now everybody in the world can see
That you've become the biggest part of me
And I could never leave you for another

Oh when you come close to me
I know this is the way
That it's supposed to be
Ever since that day
You came up around my way
You're all that I think of
And I know this must be love

You got me saying things I would not say
On top my things to do today
All I ever want to do is love ya
It's like I was blind but now I see
I can't believer the change inside of me
And baby I'm beginning to discover
The bed gives
Cupboard might break underneath you
Hard as I try
The table might shake
Could break a leg when I do what I do
I'm all about mine

Consider the love we made
When pleasure can be found
In and all around
The right place is on the floor
Why don't we get down on the floor
I won't leave you wanting for more
If we get down on the floor
On the floor
Comfortable spot
When I get you hot
A place to lay your head
Was it Socrates who said
Good to the last drop lady
Ooh you're so sweet
From your head to your feet
Face is turning red
Now my appetite's there

When you're satisfied
That's when I'll give you more
It's gonna rain let it pour
And if you're gonna stay
And you're willing to play
It's time that we openly honestly
Get on the floor

On the floor
On the floor
On the floor
Floor on the floorHow how we carried on
How I used to walk with you and talk with you
Until I moved away
Oh although some things may change
Others stay the same
We're not four anymore
But can you come out and play
You wore pigtails and hand me downs
I banged the piano played the clown
And though time slips away
It can never replace how you'll always be here
In this heart of me
Lucy and Linus and Charlie Brown
Oh how Snoopy he never left the ground
Oh that is true
You remember me like I remember you
Oh I wonder where you are
My heart says you're not far from me
It's so hard for me to leave those years behind
Oh cotton candy carousels
Got to find a wishing well to wish you back to me
That's the way I feel inside
You wore pigtails and hand me downs
I banged the piano played the clown
And though time slips away it can never replace
How you'll always be here in this heart of me
Lucy and Linus and Charlie Brown
Oh how Snoopy he never made a sound
Oh that is true
You remember me like I
How we laughed in the face of danger
Tanto and Lone Ranger
There were no mountains we could not climb
We soared like eagles cross the sky
Heaven knows how I miss your little toesHe was a king without a crown
Thy hanged him on on his throne
And nailed him in the ground
The prophet he upon the tree
Sacrificed himself for the whole world to see
He bled for you he bled for me
On that day that day on Calvary
It was a day forget I never will
It was the day the earth stood still
It was for real
Upon the hill
The Savior gave his life
So you and I might live
He had to die
To pay redemption's price
It was the only day the angels ever cried
He died for you he died for me
The lonely road on his way to Calvary
It was the day forget I never will
It was the day the earth stood still
Then came Sunday morning
The angels sang and the stone it rolled away
It was the day forget I never will
It was the day the earth stood still
So wipe your weeping eyes
'Cause he died for you and I
And he's coming back again
So every time we sinDear every time you're near
Unreal as it may seem
I step right out of a dream
Oh my did you fall down from the sky
To cause my world to spin
Now I'm back in love again

Marilie I know you're the one for me
Yo te queiro a si
Every time I look into your eyes
Marilie the most beautiful eyes ever seen
You're everything I'll ever need
You help me be all I can be
That's why I love you Marilie
I feel like I could fly
With your hand in my hands
I'm some kind of superman
See now you and I are here
Still what goes up comes down
I'll never let you touch the ground
I can hear her heartbeat from a thousand miles
Hear the heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet I'm run into to her like a river strong
She gives me love love love love crazy love
She gives me love love love love crazy love
She got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come home to her when the sun goes down
Takes my troubles all away take away my grief
Take away my heartache in the night like a thief
She gives me love love love love crazy love
She gives me love love love love crazy love
Yes I need yes I need her in the daytime
And oh I need yes I need her in the night
I want to throw my arms all around her
To kiss and hug and kiss and hug her tight
And oh
And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me sweet sweet lovin' brighten up my day
It make me righteous and it makes me whole
Makes me mellow down into my soul
She she gives me love love love love crazy love
She gives me love love love crazy love
One more time she gives love la la la love 
When I wake up in the morning
She gives me love love love
Crazy LoveTell tell me it isn't so
You say you have your reasons for leaving
You have to go
I watch you turn and walk away
And I'm searching to find
The right words to say
Hoping and praying you'll stay

So I'll kiss your love goodbye
I guess it wasn't meant to be
I gave my all you've tried
And now I see
The love caught my eye
I went blind
And now it makes me cry
The only thing I can do
Is kiss your love goodbye
Why why should I look deep inside
To find where I went wrong girl
'Cause after all you'll still be gone
Oh how I've tried
Though I gave my best to you
You were determined to leave
And there's nothing I can do
Guess that none of my dreams won't come true

I won't ask you why

Give me back my pride
'Cause time will mend
The heart that you've broken baby
I'll let you go
Though I love you so
I'll find a way to kiss your love goodbye

I guess it wasn't meant to be
I gave my all you've tried
And now I see
The love caught my eye
I went blind
Now it makes me cry
The only thing I can do
Is kiss your love
Is kiss your love
Is kiss your love goodbye
GoodbyeYour love is ooh
Your love is ooh baby
I contemplate as we lay
Caught up in your web of pleasure
Let me get my thoughts together
Concentrate stimulate
Ecstacy cannot be measured
I finally found my treasure

When I think about the love we make
I can't find the word to say your love is ooh
Your love is ooh baby
When I think about the the love we make
I run out of breath and I start to shake
your love is ooh
Your love is ooh baby
Take the sun
Take the moon
All I ever need is you
You make my dreams come true
Through the storm nice and warm
Girl you know just what to do
You know just what to do
I'm just an ordinary man
I don't understand
Why the way that I feel gets so hard for me
To explain
Am I dreamin'

And my heart is beating sore from being
Loved so beyond my needs
All I know is I want the world to know
Your love is oh
Your love is oh
Your love is ohMaxine was 5'9''
Had a man and she didn't mind
Walked up to me nice and slow
What she wanted
I did not know
Gave me her pager number
And said call her anytime
Then she whispered in my ear

She said
My body wants you so
For what I miss at home
Nobody has to know
Keep it
On the down and low
She said
My body wants you so
For what I miss at home
Nobody has to know
Keep it
On the down and low
She says that he
Doesn't take her anywhere
Used to say sweet things
Acts like he doesn't even care
He thinks that she's content
'cause he buys her cars
And he pays her rent
But she's not ready to leave
She turned and said to me

I wouldn't treat you that way
If you were my lady
I wouldn't share you
You'd be mine and mine alone oh yeah
If he continues wastin' your time
Girl he's crazy
I'll take her

Maxine looked into my eyes
Wanted me to be the other guy
'cause tonight she's needin' someone to hold
Lonely nights can be oh so cold
Deprived of all the things
She misses wants wishes and needs
Got hotter than a hundred an' three
She turned and said to me

You can call me day and night night and day
Girl you're all that I want
I need you up around my way
We go together like a potter and clay
Girl you're all that I want
I need you up around my way
Michael Angelo would faint
Rembrandt would cry
To stand in line for a lock of your hair
I'd fly around around the world
Just to be close to you
Anytime anyplace anywhere

Just tell me what I should do
Tell me what I should say
Rub me I'm your genie
Your wish is my command right away
Can we talk about it
Lady can we get together
I'm free I'm free
Left of the sun
Right of the moon
You're hotter than the fourth of July
One taste of your sweet sweet lips
Will have me doing cartwheels and flips
Kinda shy to say that I'm sweating you
Judging by the smile on your face
Says I'm getting through
You no rush come will the day
You come around my way
Come on
I could feel
It coming from a mile away
When I opened up the door
I saw everything that I've been waiting for hey
Close your eyes
I don't care what other people say
Here underneath the stars
Now Jupiter and Mars don't seem so far away

I want you to know
You take my breath away
And it's been that way right from the start
I didn't know how to tell you
That I want to love you
With every beat of my heart

Take my hand
Don't be afraid don't go
I want you to stay
Just relax your mind
I promise that tomorrow will be just like today
Lullaby say good night
Close your eyes
Fall away to sleep
Eyes like mine
Don't you cry
Cause tomorrow there'll be much more
To see
Don't you cry
Say goodnight and fall asleepI have been through many disappointments and regrets
Never known yet
The joy of lasting love
Now I'm reaching for your hand
On the shore of happiness
Oh acquiesce
To you my dear my love

You take my breath away
You're everything I desire
I can't stay away
I used to say never
But I'll never say never again
Every night and day
I realize what can't be denied
I never thought I'd fall
But I fell anyway
And I know that I know that I know that
I never thought I'd fall but I fell
Anyway
You're the perfect lover
And you are the perfect friend
Now all that's ever been
We simply rose above
And as long as we don't build
A castle on quicksand
We'll experience and understand
The pleasure of lasting love
My heart's on fire
Burning with a flame that will never die
There's a voice inside
Saying don't be afraid don't compromise

There are many many words that I could say
Melodies I could could play
Prayers that I can pray
Nothing could take your love away
You take my breath away
You're everything I desire
I can't stay away
I used to say never
But I'll never say never again
Every night and day
I realize what can't be denied
I never thought I'd fall
But I fell anyway
And I know that I know that I know that
I never thought I'd fall but I fell anyway
I know
I never thought I'd fall but I fell
Anyway
Look
Shit just ain't the same
When you slide through 
I get distracted every time you in my view 
Plus I hear you kinda single right now boo 
And I got a perfect spot for a tattoo 
I get ya name more than once if I have to 
Me and you up at a classic then buy you
Cause I got a few places you can fly to
Bring ya partners cause you know I'm bringin' my crew

Neither one of us can get to sleep
'Cause what's on your mind
Is what's on my mind
And both of us know we just may regret it
And neither one of us can fight the truth
'Cause you feelin' me and I'm feelin' you
And both of us hope we will never forget it
'Cause we are closer and we touch
And the feeling gets too much
No need to hurry no need to rush
And I'm tellin' you

Neither one of us can shake the past
Are we movin' to slow

And neither one us wants to slide to win
If forever was low and got to spin
And us can true if we just say it
So cause we are closer and we touch
And the feeling gets too much
No need to hurry no need to rush
And I say to you girl i say to you

Ohh what we have right here now baby
Is good for me is all good you
Is all we were waiting for
Take my hand
And i take you to that special place
Come with me to this open door
Star light star bright
Have you ever felt the way I feel tonight
Sparkle in your eyes as the diamond shines
Guaranteeing that you'll always be mine
Let me tell you for the rest of my life I'll be true
Here to tell you this evening
And the rest of my days and nights belong to you
You can believe that there ain't nothing in this world that I'd rather do
Now and forever my heart belongs to you
Now and forever for the rest of my life I love you
And it's alright go ahead and cry
I'm so happy now that I could die

And you touched my soul
More than you know
So afraid that you would tell me
Let me tell you for the rest of my life I'll be true
Here to tell you this evening
And the rest of my days and nights belong to you
You can believe that there ain't nothing in this world that I'd rather do
Now and forever my heart belongs to you
Now and forever for the rest of my life I love you
The countdown has begun until the day
And I know that we're gonna be together come what may
And if you want me and need to always be there
Constantly patiently taking good care
I'll be there you'll know I'll be there
For the rest of my life I'll be true
And the rest of my days and nights belong to you
You can believe that there's nothing in this world that I'd rather do
Now and forever my heart belongs to you
Now and forever for the rest of my life I love you
I love youI try to pull myself together
One lie tore us apart
We left so many words unspoken
You walked away with my heart
And I cried I cried
Heaven knows how much I cried
Could you find the strength within you
To give me one more try
If I called you would you believe what I had to say
And if I saw you would you turn and run away
If I had my way girl you'd be with me right now
Someday someway somehow
Someday someway somehow
I thought that I could go on without you
Guess what I was so wrong
And I realized how much I really love you
And it's been far too long
I know you cried I know you cried
Heaven knows how much you cried
But can you find the strength within you
To give me one more try
If I called you would you believe what I had to say
And if I saw you would you turn and run away
If I had my way girl you'd be with me right now
Someday someway somehow
Someday someway somehow
So come on don't I get my one mistake
Let's forget about yesterday for tomorrow
I know we've found what's at the end of the rainbow
And it's meant to be it's meant to be
If I called you would you believe what I had to say
And if I saw you would you turn and run away
If I had my way girl you'd be with me right now
Someday someway somehow
Someday someway somehow
Someday someway somehowFor every little girl and every little boy
Whose mother and father is across the waters
Fighting the war that they know nothing about
We pray for You tonight God help us listen
We're running outta time can't waste it can't waste it
Have you seen the news today
War is on the uprise who said it was to be this way
Lord I know that millions won't make it yes Lord
This life's all I have to live and I'll gladly give it
To be one of the one's who did thank You
Ever since creation we've been counting down the time
From then to now and we will see nations fighting nations
I hide the world inside my heart then I read about
Man inventing weapons of mass destruction to tear us all apart
But like the rising of the sun
We're waiting for You to come and take us away
Those of us who believe in You believe me when I say
We're running outta time can't waste it
Have you seen it have you seen the news today Guess what
War is on the uprise who said it was to be this way
Lord I know that millions won't make it but I'm so glad Jesus
This life's all I have to live and I'll gladly give it
To be one of the one's who did
I'm gonna hang on to You Lord
I'm gonna stay strong for You Lord yeah
I'm gonna keep holding on gonna keep holding on
To Your unchanging hand Lord You know the plan
That You have for me it's not my will
But Your way and I'm gonna follow that way Lord
Oh Lordy with a madeup mind I'm willing to go on through
I'm not gonna worry about what my friends might say
Or my friends might do hey
I'm gonna follow You Lord I'm gonna follow You Lord
If I let it all go if my momma if my momma don't go
If my sista don't go if my brotha don't go
I'm going I'm going through Lord
If my preacher don't go said I'm going
Oh Lordy oh Lordy oh Lordy
I surrender all with a madeup mind
I'm going through oh care
So Father we pray right now that You hear our cries
For peace for restoration give us hope right now
Without You we can't make it we've tried and we're sorry
But we look to the hills from it cometh our help
'Cause we know our help comes from You
We're gonna hold on I said we're gonna hold on to You
We're not gonna let go this time Father
We're gonna trust and have faith the size of a mustard seed
Bless your name Father You're worthy You're worthy thank YouOh yeah crazy how right out of the blue
I bumped into you today
And I forgot the reasons why
Why I went away
Funny how fate opens the door
And destiny walks in
The only thing that I know for sure
Exactly how long it's been
'cause baby it's been so long
Since I had you here with me
Baby it's been so long
Baby come to me
Do you ever think of us
And the way it used to be
Late at night I long for your touch
All the things you do to me
They say it's just like riding a bike
Some thing you never forget
You know all the things I like
Let's see how much harder it gets
So baby it's been so long
Since I had you here with me
Baby it's been so long
Baby come to me
They're playing our song
Oh baby now it might be wrong
Oh baby now I hope that this night don't end
Oh baby but it might be right
Oh baby now right here tonight
Oh baby now what do you say
Can you stay
'cause baby it's been so long
Since I had you here with me
Baby it's been so long
Baby come to me
Baby it's been so long
Since I had you here with me
Baby it's been so long
Baby come to me
Baby it's been so long
Since I had you here with me
Baby it's been so long
Baby come to meFor every time you had to go asleep alone
For every time I tried to rush you off the phone
For every time I said something to make you cry
Now that all is said and done I can't deny
I'm so sorry for anything I might have done
And I'm sorry I never meant to hurt the only one
And I'm sorry the best laid plans sometimes fall through
For anything that I might've done I apologize to you
For anything that I might've done I apologize to you
For every time I lied right to your face
And you knew it
For all the wasted time that we cannot replace
For every time that a discussion turned into an argument we'd fight
Hey how I wish that I could have it back tonight
I'm so sorry for anything I might have done
And I'm sorry I never meant to hurt the only one
And I'm sorry the best laid plans sometimes fall through
For anything that I might've done I apologize to you
For anything that I might've done I apologize to you
To try and count your tears would be like standing in the rain
The weather's been bad for year  for that I'll gladly take the blame
Now our two separate lives will never ever be the same
But I hope that you can forgive someday
I'm so sorry for anything I might have done
And I'm sorry I never meant to hurt the only one
And I'm sorry the best laid plans sometimes fall through
For anything that I might've done I apologize to you
For anything that I might've done I apologize to youIt's been so long since I touched your face
It's been so long since I had the taste
It's been so long since I had you here with me
It's been so long since I yesterdays
It's been so long since you get away
It's been so long I never thought I would have seen you again
So that's why girl I don't want to let you go
That's why feeling starts let you know
That's why baby girl don't tell me no
Why don't we try our love again
So that's why you're the woman I should be with
That's why miss you more than a little bit
That's why think I have had enough of this
Why don't we try our love again
It's been so long has been quite a while
It's been so long since I seen that smile
It's been so long since I had you close to me
It's been so long so much has changed
It's been so long girl I take the blame
It's been so long but I knew someday I'll see you again
I used to have you here with me
I think about you constantly
And I just had to let you know
Can't remember why I let you go
But here we got us a second chance
The answers are our true romance
And we don't have to be alone
It's time for you to come on homeOh baby hey

Can I live for yesterday
Just give me a song to sing
and a melody to play
Don't know much about the stars up in the sky
Not afraid of what might be
You're the reason for the twinkle in my eye
Cause I have you here with me
Cause every time I'm with you
And every time we touch
And every time I'm missing you
I'm missing you so much
And every time I'm away from you
You're all that i think of
And every time we're making love I can't
I can't get enough
Don't know much about the wind in the trees
I'll leave that up to someone else
I can't wait to have you next to me
so I can have you all to myself
It's so intoxicating when I look into the eyes of the one who gives our love to me
Baby you're my one and only
You will always be the apple of my eye and I'll never leave you lonely
Every time I'm with you
and every time we touch
And every time I'm missing you
I'm missing you so much
And every time I'm away from you
you're all that I think of
And every time we're making love I can't
I can't get enough
I don't never want to miss your kiss goodnight
I want to be right here by your side every morning
When you open up your eyes
Your eyes your eyes
Every time I'm with you
and every time we touch
And every time I'm missing you
I'm missing you so much
And every time I'm away from you
you're all that I think of
And every time we're making love I can't
I can't get enoughSo long is the night
Without you by my side
To feel you breathe
So selfishly oh mine
Feeling come alive
When I look into your eyes
Feel you reach
Way down deep inside
You're my world 
You're my girl 
Every time your lips meet mine

Body's weak heart is pounding

Exmarks the spot sure I keep diggin
Coz I know it's just a matter of time

You're body's burnin
As the world keeps turnin and turnin
You're the lamb I'm the lion
Coz I know that you were made to be mine
I feel chills coming down
And I feel I'm stuck down in my toes

Till it feels like im about to explode explode
Coz I cant take it no I cant take it no I cant take it no more
No I cant take it no I cant take it no I cant take it no more
Here's a myth bodies glistening
To your heartbeat baby im listenin
We are one with the rhythm
Of the passion that were feelin inside
This lover reminds of the time that were so beautiful wild and free
And we play in the moonlight under the starlight stay here forever with me

AhIn every heart there is a drum that beats
Steady and strong it does not know defeat
I feel it pound and know the sound
Of true beliefs
In every soul there is a memory
Of standing tall the proudest we could be
I cannot fall for I recall
We were born in majesty
And when the long fight has been fought and won
We'll stand in the sun

And we will raise out hands
And we will touch the sky
Together we will dance in robes of gold
And we will leave the world remembering
When we were kings when we were kings
Now is the time here is the mountain top
When one man climbs the rest are lifted up
With every step we're closer yet
To a higher destiny
And when we reach out to claim the thrown
Every man will know

Do you remember
When we were kings
Float like a butterfly sting like a bee
Float like a butterfly sting like a bee
And when the long fight has been fought and won
We'll stand in the sun
A tall long island's calling out my name
Sealedup Patrn won't make me feel the same
Macallan 12 on ice
Always gets me feeling nice
Gonna do this tonight right in front of your friends
Yeah
Last time I saw you I froze up it's true
I'm gonna need some liquid courage just to talk to you
And ask you for a dance
Not looking for romance
Hope that I'm tight
It's about to begin
Yeah
Don't give me just enough to drink
To get me tipsy
Don't give me just enough to drink
To ask you out on the floor
Till I'm feeling fantastic elastic gymnastic
Ready for more
Don't give me just enough to drink
Don't give me just enough to drink
Take a few sips and then I start to sweat
Take a few more 'cause I don't see you yet
I know tonight's the night
I'm almost feeling right
Then I look at the front and you're 'bout to come in
Yeah
And you're looking so good like you always do
Like they made the lights
Just for you
Then you turn around and
it looks like your walking away
Mmmm

Is it bad that I only want to be together
'Cause each passing second it just keeps getting better keeps getting better

And the way that she's moving across the room
She knows exactly what she's here to do
She's getting closer now I get high
Something's coming off of me the more I look in her eyes
My baby's waiting at home there's no way I'm leaving her alone
Temptation
Temptation you won't get the best of me
Won't get the best of me no more
Temptation You won't get the best of me
Won't get the best of me no more
She walked right out from the pages of my passions
Got that same sensuous smile right down to her fine ass
She's poetry in motion every move she makes
And she wants my immediate attention for some old times sake
I tried to explain get her to understand
Things are different now see I'm a family man
Don't waste your time and effort trying to get me hot
No way in this world am I trying to lose what I got
Temptation you won't get the best of me
Won't get the best of me no more
Temptation You won't get the best of me
Won't get the best of me no more
Son you can never give in
'Cause if you let it begin
You will never be able to stop
You gotta do whatever it takes
Learn from all my mistakes
And don't ever play games with her heart whoo
Temptation you won't get the best of me
Won't get the best of me no more
Temptation you won't get the best of me
Won't get the best of me no more
Temptation you won't get the best of me
Won't get the best of me no more
Temptation you won't get the best of me
Won't get the best of me no moreOne look in your eye

With you I see forever you are the one
Girl you're everything I need and more
You are my everything my everything
For sure
My heart beats for you
You are a light in the darkness
You make me feel brand new
And looking in your eyes
I can tell you feel the same way too
Do I love you Baby I do
I'd sail across the ocean bring you the sun
With you I see forever you are the one
Girl you're everything I need and more
You are my everything my everything
For sure
Wish I may wish I might
To have you here in my arms for the rest of my life
I pray that you'll stay in my heart for always
I'd sail across the ocean bring you the sun
With you I see forever you are the one
Girl you're everything I need and more
You are my everything my everything
For sureSome ask us how
How can we sing in a strange land
They can't seem to comprehend
They don't understand
That the message in our soul
Is from the heart
Doesn't matter how near
Doesn't matter how far
If there be one that is touched
By the things that we do
Then we're satisfied
Satisfied
And we did what we came to do
Then we'll rejoice amongst ourselves
Till we get where we're goin' to
Everything we do
We do it for you
My Lord you put it down for us
So we put it down for youShould've Been There
Every time you called
Should've Given you everything
Given you my all
But I was just selfish
Thinkin' Bout myself
Should've Given the best of me to nobody else
'Cause There's no livin' without you
And it feels like I'm losin' my mind
Baby I
Can't sleep at night
Without you
Right by my side
My pride always gets in the way
I lied
I should have begged you to stay
It may take 'Til forever is through
To get over you
Should've made you happy
Should've been strong
Should've made you believe
You were right where you belonged
Don't know what you got
'Til it's gone
Don't tell me it's too late
To right this wrong
'Cause there's no living without you
And it feels like I'm losin' my mind
Baby I
Can't sleep at night
Without you
Right by my side
My pride always gets in the way
I lied
I should have begged you to stay
It may take till forever is through
To get over you
Somethin'
Somethin' ain't right
Girl Lately
My sun doesn't shine
Wont you come back into my life

Again
Baby I
Can't sleep at night
Without you
Right by my side
My pride always gets in the way
I lied

It make take till forever is through
To get over youFunny when you stop and think

Somethings I know I need to say out loud
And we talk about it
There are matters what you need to know
And how you act determines where we go
So here we go

I don't wanna be all by my self
But I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you out you
I don't want nobody else
But I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you out you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
Without you out you
I hate it when you turn it off and on
When the mornin' love is right then you turned of and the day is gone
It's like a cycle through what's going on
It almost like we don't want it
I'm losing you and I don't know why
Used to feel so good and
Used to be so right and
Used to make love to me every single night
Girl how can we get back to
That blessful energy
You gotta give me everything
If you wanna be with me

I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
Without you out you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
Without you out you
Used to feel so good and
Used to be so right and
Used to make love to me every single night
Girl how can we get back to
That blessful energy
You gotta give me everything
If you wanna stay with me

I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
Without you out you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
Without you out youIt's the most wonderful
Time of the year
With the kids
Jinglebelling
And everyone telling you
Be of good cheer
It's the most wonderful
Time of the year
It's the haphappiest
Season of all
With those holiday greetings
And great happy meetings
When friends come to call
It's the haphappiest
Season of all
There'll be parties
For hosting
Marshmallows for roasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long long ago
It's the most wonderful
Time of the year
There'll be much
Mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing
When loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful
Time of the yearI be missin' you missin' you missin' you
I be missin' you missin' you missin' you
I be missin' you missin' you missin' you
Thinking back on yesterday
All the things I could've said but didn't say to you
Should've begged you to stay
Heard you moved on Heard you've been doing okay
Been thinking 'bout you all the time
Do you ever reminisce Do I be crossing your mind
All the tears and wasted time
Nothing's been the same since you went away
Girl I know that I
Used to be your man
Used to have you here in the palm of my hand
I let you slip away just like grains of sand
When I'm lying in my bed at night
Wish I was holding you wish I was touching you
I cry myself to sleep at night
Wish I was kissing you instead of just missing you
Girl I keep holding on Girl I keep holding on
Girl I keep holding on Girl I keep holding on
Girl I keep holding on Girl I keep holding on
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Inside me there's so many questions why
I'm still wanting to live a lie
But in my heart I know it's just too late
It's just like standing out in the pouring rain
I refuse to believe that I'll never see you again
All that's going on inside my brain
That I can't seem to get it straight
Girl I know that I
Used to be your man
Used to have you here in the palm of my hand
I let you slip away just like grains of sand
When I'm lying in my bed at night
Wish I was holding you wish I was touching you
I cry myself to sleep at night
Wish I was kissing you instead of just missing you
Girl I keep holding on Girl I keep holding on
Girl I keep holding on Girl I keep holding on
Girl I keep holding on Girl I keep holding on
And if I ever hurt you I didn't mean to treat you bad
I think about the goods times that we had
And there's no way we can be done
Girl I know that I
Used to be your man
Used to have you here in the palm of my hand
I let you slip away just like grains of sand
When I'm lying in my bed at night
Wish I was holding you wish I was touching you
I cry myself to sleep at night
Wish I was kissing you instead of just missing you
Girl I keep holding on Girl I keep holding on
Girl I keep holding on Girl I keep holding on
Girl I keep holding on Girl I keep holding onI'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
I'll be home for Christmas
There'll be snow and mistletoe
Baby how you been
Haven't seen you in a while
I don't know where to begin
But it's so good to see you smile
We were together for so long
But at that time it wasn't meant to be
I thought our happy days were gone
I thought that I wanted to be free
But now that I have you here with me
Are we making love or not making love
I can't see it in your eyes
Like I knew it would it feels twice as good
And girl I'm not surprised
You can say that you don't miss me
But girl I know your kisses don't lie
No they don't lie
Can we possibly start brand new
And can we both forget the past
Others have tried and failed
But maybe we can make it last
For is it just this once for old time's sake
For tomorrow be just like yesterday
It's funny about the heart
Somethings can't be erased
But maybe we can find a way
Are we making love or not making love
I used to see it in your eyes
Like I knew it would it feels twice as good
It comes as no surprise
You can say that you don't miss me
Girl you know your kisses don't lie
They don't lie
I think we both know
It's easier love to see
That what we have is pure gold

Are we making love or not making love
I can't see it in your eyes
Like I knew it would it feels twice as good
And girl I'm not surprised
But you can say that you don't miss me
'Cause girl you know your kisses don't lieSo lost
Sometime I feel like I'm all alone
Like I'm down here all by myself
Tell me when you comin' back to take me home
Father
I been told that the streets are paved with gold
And the lion lays with the lamb
They say it'll be nothing like I've ever known
And when I get there
All of my burdens
I can't wait to lay them down
My savior
Can't wait to see you in that sweet old by and by
Oh
The clock is tickin'
We're runnin' out of time
What I've been livin' for
Is finally about to be mine
That's why I'm gonna be everything you want me to be
Don't take your love from me
Everyday every night
That's why I'm livin' to see your face
You're the one
You're my life and I can't replace
That's why I've got to be everything you want me to be
Don't take your love from me
And when it gets hard
I still retain my faith
The harder the trials come
I still get on my knees and pray
And say thank you
I know the road will get rough
The sea will get stormy
But if I keep my eyes on you
I know you've prepared a place for me
And your word says it's true
And when I get there
All of my burdens
I can't wait to lay them down
My savior
Can't wait to see you in that sweet old by and by
Oh
The clock is tickin'
We're runnin' out of time
What I've been livin' for
Is finally about to be mine
That's why I'm gonna be everything you want me to be
Don't take your love from me
Everyday every night
That's why I'm livin' to see your face
You're the one
You're my life and I can't replace
That's why I've got to be everything you want me to be
Don't take your love from me
And do gonna do what I have to do
To make it through
I don't wanna be left down here
When you go
Clock is tickin'
We're runnin' out of time
What I've been livin' for
Is finally about to be mine
That's why I'm gonna be everything you want me to be
Don't take your love from me
Everyday every night
That's why I'm livin' to see your face
You're the one
You're my life and I can't replace
That's why I've got to be everything you want me to be

Don't take your love from meIt's seven o'clock and I'm on my way
Eating the miles down this highway
Say that you'll wait for me
To light up the Christmas tree
Tell you the first thing that I'ma do
Holding and squeezing and kissing you
Under the mistletoe
Girl I've been missing you so
This is the first holiday we'll spend
Every night I pray that it never ends
Feels like meant to be
When I have you next to me
Can't wait to have you to myself
'Cause I need you and no one else
There's no place in this world I'd rather be
'Cause you're the only present that I need
The perfect combination is Christmas you and me
The perfect combination is Christmas you and me
It's 11 o'clock and I'm almost home
I'm just calling to let you know
Leave on the light for me
Soon we'll make us some 
And I saw Santa is on his way
I saw Rudolph pulling the sleigh
Donner and Blitzen too
And he's got some presents for you
This is the first holiday we'll spend
Every night I pray that it never ends
Feels like meant to be
When I have you next to me
Can't wait to have you to myself
'Cause I need you and no one else
There's no place in this world I'd rather be
'Cause you're the only present that I need
The perfect combination is Christmas you and me
The perfect combination is Christmas you
I hear sleigh bells ringing and carolers singing
And smothered turkey's that grandma's bringing
I see children playing in the snow
It's Christmas time and I know well
That when I see you I just might melt
If you don't know by now you need to know
That I can't wait to have you to myself
'Cause I need you and no one else
There's no place in this world I'd rather be be
See you're the only present that I need
The perfect combination is Christmas you and me
Oh the perfect combination is Christmas you and me
The perfect combination is Christmas you and me
Is Christmas you and meAngels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord the newborn King
Gloria 
In excelsis Deo 
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria

Gloria in excelsis Deooria in excelsis Deo
In Excelsis DeoBless this house O Lord we pray
Make it safe by night and day   
Bless these walls so firm and stout
Keeping want and trouble out   
Bless the roof and chimneys tall
Let thy peace lie overall   
Bless this door that it may prove
Ever open
To joy and love   
Bless these windows shining bright
Letting in God's Heavenly light
Bless the hearth the painting there
With smoke ascending like a prayer
Bless the folk who dwell within
Keep them pure and free from sin   
Bless us all that we may be
Fit O Lord to dwell with thee   
Bless us all that one day we may dwell
O Lord With Thee

Mistletoe help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies
On his sleigh

Child is gonna spy to see if
Reindeer really know how to fly

One to ninetytwo

Many ways

Christ the LordThey say the truth's your best defence
I'm bleeding just to pay the rent
And broken dreams mean nothing
When you need something
Just to get you through the year
And now we're moving out
So pack your clothes your books your doubt
And bring the piece of paper
That I gave you back when you were all alone
Letters sent home with no return address
I've got a bag full of old clothes
I've got a bag full of stress
I'm so sorry that I'm leaving
You so little to believe in
'Cause we had a house
With a perfect door and a front room
With the right decor
And I came and wrecked it all
Yes I came and wrecked it all like I always do
'Cause I didn't think and I poured your life down the kitchen sink
With the dregs of yesterday
And now I'm going to be late
I'm sorry
I'm so sorry that I'm leaving
You so little to believe in
Just tell me that you're free of your woes and of me
There's weather more reliable than me
I'm calling base command as the last bit of oxygen runs out but
They're down there softly sleeping
The sun sets over the Pacific region
I'm sitting here hanging in the balance
Just barely in the atmosphere
I'm sitting here hanging in the balance
Just barely in the atmosphere
I'm so sorry that I'm leaving
You so little to believe in
Just tell me that you're free of your woes and of me
There's weather more reliable than me
As lonely as Laika
Up there all alone
You miss the atmosphere
The stars are now your homeLet me ask you baby
Well do you live here everyday of your life
In a burned out war zone
Just like Beirut or something
Man it hurts my eyes
Detroit breakdown
Got my whole damn head on fire
Detroit breakdown
Ooh what a surprise
Motown schmotown there's nothin left
No more Iggy or the MC5
Waynes been doin it in LA now
So youre just livin a lie 'cause
Detroit breakdown
Got my whole damn head on fire
Detroit breakdown
Ooh what a surprise
Let me ask you baby
Do you live here everyday of your life
Im a town that makes a career
Out of waiting for hell night
Detroit breakdown
Got my whole damn head on fire
Detroit breakdown
Ooh what a surprise
Oh yeah oh yeah yeah
Ooh what a surpriseHere we are nowhere
Surrounded by space
Angels of legends
Have taken our place
We had deliverance
The moment passed
These lost disciples
Are leading at last
We shout a hymn
To the earth and the birds
To the lost disciples
Who don't know the words
Strange collision
Of heaven and hell
A bastard vision
We know too well
Our emotions
Are all second hand
Belong to an ocean
Misplaced in the sand
We are nowhere at lastThis cat and mouse game has gone on far too long
The mousetraps that had been set have finally been sprung
The feeling's gone
So I guess this is the end 'tho I can't say I'm sad
'Cos we've had the good times now things just look bad
The feeling's gone
Can't be together
Can't be together
Now the feeling's gone
Can't be together
Can't be together
Now the feeling's gone
The geographic aspect has lessened our respect
I hear you send a letter never call direct
The feeling's gone
Why'd you check my trust my love has turned to dust
I know someone else is more important in your life
The feeling's gone
Can't be together
Can't be together
Now the feeling's gone
Can't be together
Now the feeling's gone
Can't be together
Can't be together
Now the feeling's gone
Can't be together
Can't be together
Now the feeling's gone
Now that we've broken the last ties of the hearts
Those who used to think that we could have played our parts
The feeling's gone
Memories of a romance all gone with the last dance
Now we won our freedom there's no second chance
The feeling's gone
Can't be together
Can't be together
Now the feeling's gone
Can't be together
Now the feeling's goneWhen I find myself watching the time
I never think about all the funny things you said
I feel like it's dead
Where is it leading me now
I turn around in the still of the room
Knowing this is when I'm gonna make my move
Can't wait any longer
And I'm feeling stronger but oh
Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pullin' me back
Back to love you
I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark
He holds me close like a thief of the heart
He plays a melody
Born to tear me all apart
The silence is broken
And no words are spoken but oh
Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pullin' me back
Back to love you
I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the darkYou can reach me by railway
You can reach me by trailway
You can reach me on an airplane
You can reach me with your mind
You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here
Just get here if you can
You can reach me by sail boat
Climb a tree and swing rope to rope
Take a sled and slide down the slope
Into these arms of mine
You can jump on a speedy colt
Cross the border in a blaze of hope
I don't care how you get here
Just get here if you can
There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
If I had my way surely you would be closer
I need you closer
You can windsurf into my life
Take me up on a carpet ride
You can make it in a big balloon
But you better make it soon
You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here
Just get here if you can
I don't care I don't care
I want you to get here
I need you right here right now
I need you closer
I can't wait another day

And come on it's been a revelation yeah
You've been an inspiration to me

And my heart will run to you
Oh oh it's something
You better believe it
You and I have something
I don't wanna lose this time babe
And hope you can see that
'Cause you and I have something
In my heart I can't believe we've been so blind
Looks like we've wasted so much time
There's not a doubt that rings untrue
Said when I'm with you
Oh you and I got something
Come on oh oh it's something
Oh you and I we got something

If I'll go under or give you love you need
Will stars always be in heaven
I'm only guessin' as far as I can see
I could never give up loving the sun
How could I deny such a perfect one
So when you want the time dear
I have to spend here I'll gladly share with you
My life as far as I imagined
There would be passion if only you stay close
I could never give up wanting to fly
What's a bird in flight without any sky
You make me smile it's been a while
Since I felt this way won't you stay
Your kiss so light as a feather pull me together
And I'm a stormy sea
So shall I ask my question just a suggestion
Won't you just give your love to me
My love make it magic
It would be tragic if you let go of me
I know all the things that sadden could never end
If only you stay close to me
I give it to me
'Cause I didn't think about what we had
All the posibilities I will not give it back
No I don't want just give it back
Feelings are sad 

I'm sorry
Forgive me
I'm begging
And bleeding
I said I'm sorry
Forgive me
I love you
Believe me
I hope you're 
I'm here 

To give my heart 
You need time
And time and passion
Let's move ahead
No hesitasions
'Cause I realize about what we had
All the posibilities I will not give it back
No I anything just to give it back
Feelings are sad 

I'm sorry
Forgive me
I'm begging
And bleeding

I hope you're I don't wanna be no Catholic boy
I just wanna have some fun
I don't wanna be no Catholic boy
And get beat by the nuns
I don't wanna kneel I don't wanna feel
Guilty suppression
I wanna beat my meat right in the street
Dominus vobiscum
The kids are passing out in the pew
I'm looking for a hanging jew
Don't wanna be no fool
Go to no procial school
I don't wanna be no Catholic boy
I just wanna live in sin
I don't wanna be no Catholic boy
I don't wanna have to say amen
I got a nuclear explosion
Breathing down my back
And my brain is burning
Look through the pins in my eyes
Well I don't care about living

And I don't care if I die
I got a flame thrower love
Honey can't you seeAll my boyhood friends told me I'd fail
Spend my lifetime friendless or in jail
And all the girls at the school dance
Wouldn't give me a second chance
But I won't look back
I remember all their social games
Gossip spreading talk among the lames
Friday night's lonely passions
Empty heads with no reactions
Now
But I won't look back
Now I've gone and lost their scene
The only time I see them's in a dream
With all them trying to hurt me
But now they know what I can be
But I won't look backI want you back again
I want your love again
I know you find it hard
To reason with me
But this time is different
Darling you'll see
You gotta
Tell me your coming back to me
You said we're through before
You walked out on me before
I hear the knock on my door
But then it never came
I hear the telephone
But it hasn't rungAin't it fun
When you're always on the run
Ain't it fun
When your friends despise what you've become
Ain't it fun
When you get so high that you well you just can't cum
Ain't it fun
When you know that you're gonna die young
It's such fun

Yeah fun
Such fun
Such fun fun fun
Yeah fun
Such fun
Such fun fun fun
Yeah fun
Such fun
Such
Ain't it fun
When you're taking care of number one
Ain't it fun
When you feel like you just gotta get a gun
Ain't it fun
When you just just can't seem to find your toungue
Cause you stuck it too deep into somethin that really stung
It's such fun
Well you come up to me
They spit right in my face
I didn't even feel it
It was such a disgrace
I punched my fist right through the glass
I didn't even feel it
It happened so fast

Ain't it fun
When you tell her she's just a cunt
Ain't it fun
When she splits and leaves you all alone
Ain't it fun
When you've broken up every band that you've ever begun
Ain't it fun
When you know that you're gonna die young
It's such fun
You shining in the sky
Faster than the naked eye
I'm calling calling calling on you
Things here got outta hand
Take me back to the promised land
I'm calling calling calling on you
Tonight is Friday night
I'm hanging around dying to leave
I'm calling calling calling on you
Star shining in the sky
Faster than the naked eye
I'm calling calling calling calling on youThere ain't no future and there ain't no past
There's just a graveyard and it's coming fast
Well we want the truth we're the modern youth
History has warned ya of and we're down to kill
We're the 3rd generation nation
I could make money playing corporate rock
I ain't got nothing rather live in hock
Well we can't be told we're out of control
Adults they're afraid of me 'cause we're down to kill
We're the 3rd generation nation
Nothing is new or hasn't been said it's all been done before
Yet you're all laughing laughing at me but don't cha laugh at me
The better world you tried to build exploded in your face
Yet you're laughing laughing at me
We're the 3rd generation nationLast night in the middle of a dream
Fiery red dog eyes double beamed
Tellin' me directions of my soul
Poured my life inside a bullet hole
I am a son of Sam
I got death breathing from my hand
I can't resist I cannot fight
I've fallen victim to his bite
I have killed six but I'll kill more
Sam commands my 44
I am a son of Sam
I got death breathing from my hand
Take me and strap me
To the electric chair
But you'll never kill me
I'll always be thereCaretakers of the streets
Virgins with tainted saviours
Hippies hustling chump change
Don't know the days from the night

Dead and alive ain't breathing I'm
Dead and alive feeling so damn
Dead and alive
Being a servant by day
Smiling and stroking my way
I get my lovin' outta magazines
But keep your hands offa me

Murder takes a city's night
Feeding it's wanton flame
Come excite the streets with me
But don'tcha ask my name
Snake in the Grass
Woe is me
I am never gonna work for free
Not for you again my heart doesn't bleed
I'm busy working while you're cruisin' blasting Biggie
Greedy little piggy
Look at your whip so cool 
Wishin' I was you
Built a palace up in solitude
You're kinda like the bros at John and Richmond
Girl in shotgun bitching on and
I will take it all from you
I will take it all
It never bothered me
The thunder has passed
You know I needed you but how could I ask
The sky is falling and it ain't gonna last
The truth is hiding like a snake in the grass
Watch it slither past
Look at your style so fly 
It's hard not to look
A carbon copy you could write the book
The joint was cranked so loud
You couldn't hear the storm that's
Raging up inside of me
I will take it all from you
I will take it all
It never bothered me
The thunder has passed
You know I needed you but how could I ask
The sky is falling and it ain't gonna last
The truth is hiding like a snake in the grass
Watch it slither past
There's a great divide
From where I am to where I can't decide
If you gave a little I'd let it slide
If you did I know I said I'd make it better
Then again I said a lot of things
I'll take my lights down
Shoot the gift I've had it all but a melt down
Grab the fish and flip my desk like a sad clown
And in time you will see when the bomb drops
I would never call the cops
The thunder has passed
You know I needed you but how could I ask
The sky is falling and it ain't gonna last
The truth is hiding like a snake in the grass
Watch it slither pastBed Spins
She'll close her mouth and nothing's said
The world is spinning 'round my bed
Falling backwards time is stuck
They moved the goal post just my luck
Violated
The city moans
Violated
Let it go
She lies to me and lies awake
Watch the backs of camel's break
Daylight floods and hits my eyes
Shotgun sounds the children's smiles
She calls and calls and eyes set sail
Broken dreams among her tails
Burning candles at both ends stoned
God damn woman should've stayed home
Violated
The city moans
Violated
Let it go
I never needed it
I never needed it
I never needed any of it
I never needed it
I never needed it
I never needed any of this
Let it out
She calls and calls and eyes set sail
Broken dreams among her tails
Burning candles at both ends stoned
God damn woman should've stayed home
Violated
The city moans
Violated
Let it goFame
You are the last one to walk away
You are the silence in my everyday
The separation never seems to smile
The situation leaves you in denial
It's just the same
Not concerned about the fame
You give an inch and 
Run and tear your family wild
When history's comin' back in style
Hurry up and run it through
Gonna live forever if I get it together
Just the same
Not concerned about the fame
You're so cliche I am in pain
I'm not concerned about the fame
The fame
Laughing like the 4th of July
When kingdom come has come on by
Hurry up and run it through
Man I know you wanna
smell the marijuana
All the same
Not concerned about the fame
You're so cliche I am in pain
Not concerned about the fame
The fame
Running out of reasons why
This is the fastest that I've ever died
Hurry up and run it through
Gonna live forever if I get it together
Just the same
Not concerned about the fame
You're so cliche I am in pain
I'm not concerned about the fame
The fameControl
Twisting in me how did it start
So unaware falling apart
Sign of the times drawing the line
Waiting to feel hoping I'll find
Waiting outside waiting alone
Clutching my pride denial of being alone
Losing control fall on my feet
Eager to please eager to speak
Try to fit in playing the part
Hoping I'll be same as they are
Sleeping through days pounding of time
Ticking away patience my crime
Living outside living alone
Never a fear never of being alone
Ocean of ghosts time in the air
Wade in the tide they won't despair
Cynical drifts paying no doubt
We never learn crash and we're out
Close to the clear a moment I had
Is it supposed supposed to bleed this badScratch
You are well aware we're waiting
You are well aware there's something wrong
You're making up for something
One day I'm gonna move away
One day I'm gonna go and leave it behind
And make a lot of money
The fire in your heart is out now
But you'll never know 'til it's too late
You're making up for something
I can't look
Wait
I don't think I waited too long
Maybe if my price changes I'll go
Wait
I don't think I waited too long
Maybe if my price changes I'll go
You could see me and hear my swan song
Take my hand it's stronger than I be
Roaming around so I can hold my head strong
The fire in your heart is out now
But you'll never know 'til it's too late
Making up for something
The timing isn't all the great and
Suddenly it's more than I can bare
Making up for something
Wait
I don't think I waited too long
Maybe if my price changes I'll go
Wait
I don't think I waited too long
Maybe if my price changes I'll go
You could see me and hear my swan song
Take my hand it's stronger than I be
Roaming around so I can hold my head strongVerse 1 
Can I just say what's on my mind
Cause i'm so sick of wasting time
I'm growing up and getting younger
Shot gun wedding for your girlfriend's father
Getting used to this bad news
HOW I messed up
Now i'm black and blue
Think back on everything
Everyword you ever said to me
Chorus
Cause you held it against me
And you were never sorry
Got every reason to be angry
If i'm being honest
Would you take back everything
And pretend that you don't know me
Why you gotta pretend you don't know me
Verse 2
What do you want from me
I just wanted honesty
Is that enough for you to take from me
You told me honesty
Is that that enought for you to take from me
Tell me everything
You ever wanted to say
Even if it never meant anything
Chorus
Cause you held it against me
And you were never sorry
Got every reason to be angry
If i'm being honest
Would you take back everything
And pretend that you don't know me
Why you gotta pretend you don't know me
Bridge
Sucks when your words get twisted
And the weight is put on me
You always play the victim
When you're the enemy
Against me
Against me
Chorus
Cause you held it against me
And you were never sorry
Got every reason to be angry
If i'm being honest
Would you take back everything
And pretend that you don't know me
Why you gotta pretend you don't know me
End
Sucks when your words get twisted
Sucks when your words get twisted
Sucks when your words get twistedOh honor for all
All the big and the small
Well the taller they stand
Well the harder they fall
We live for today but we die for the next
with blood in our veins and the air in our chest
Oh we step into war with our hearts on the line
Dirt on our boots it shakes free over time
The music it fades the violin slows
The darkness it rises as the sun goes
Love is a distant aroma at best
A withering smile thats stuck deep in your vest
The night air it wraps its fingers around
Your body it shakes from the now distant sound
Oh the sound of her voice  a sweet symphony
Played over and over until you are free
The music it fades the violin slows
The darkness arises as the sun goes
Can you feel the new day rising
Climbing up the east horizon
They can't hold us
Now we'll fight through
Each and every one
will start new
Well we shall not stumble
No we shall not fall
We shall not crumble
No we shall stay tall
Well death it will come
As sure as the night
We will not run
No we live but to fight
With blood on our hands
And dirt on our knees
We tear at the ones
Who brought the disease
The music it fades the violin slows
The darkness it rises as the sun goes
Can you feel the new day rising
Climbing up the east horizon
They can't hold us
Now we'll fight through
Each and every one
Will start newYou broke my heart 'cause I couldn't dance
You didn't even want me around
And now I'm back to let you know I can really shake 'em down
Do you love me 
Do you love me 
Now do you love me

Watch me now
 ah work it out baby
 well I'm gonna drive you crazy
 ah just a little bit of soul now

Now I can mash potatoes 
I can do the twist 
Tell me baby do you like it like this
Tell me tell me
Do you love me
Do you love me baby
Now do you love me

Watch me now
 ah work it out baby
 well I'm gonna drive you crazy
 you are getting kind of cold now

 with just a little bit of soul now 
 come on come on now
 I'm gonna drive you crazy

I can mash potatoes
I can do the twist
Well now tell me baby do you like it like this
Tell me tell me
Do you love me
Do you love me baby
Do you love me

Now that I can dance
 ah work it out baby
 well I'm gonna drive you crazy
 oh you are getting kind of cold now

 with just a little bit of soul now
 now don't you get kinda bold now
 oh work it out babyYeah yeah yeah yeah
It's a cold man to hurt his woman
And watch her walk away crying
When all along he knows he's wrong
Being so hard on a woman who's trying
I was so unkind to hurt you so
Going out of my mind
I just gotta let you know that
Baby I just can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so
Our love surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding
I remember you said
You would always care
Until death should we do part
Baby surely must be our destiny
To die the death of a broken heart
So before I go a wandering rover
Let's get together
Talk this thing over now
Baby I just can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so
Our love surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding
That's all it is
If our love is so wrong
It just seems wrong
That our love could never be
You could be anywhere
Baby I wouldn't care
If I thought that you're leaving me
All the chains in the world

Like the our your love

Baby I just can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so
Our love surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding
That's all it is
Baby I just can't let you go 
I realize I hurt you so 
Our love surely can we mend it

It's just a little misunderstanding
Baby 
I just can't let you goSome fellas look at the eyes
Some fellas look at the nose
Some fellas look at the size
Some fellas look at the clothes
I don't care if her eyes are red
I don't care if her nose is long
I don't care if she's underfed
I don't care if her clothes are worn
First I look at the purse
Some fellas like the smiles they wear
Some fellas like the legs that's all
Some fellas like the style of their hair
Want their waist to be small
I don't care if their legs are thin
I don't care if their teeth are big
I don't care if their hair's a wig
Why waste time lookin' at the waistline
First I look at the purse
A woman can be fat as can be
kisses sweet as honey
But that don't mean a thing to me
If you ain't got no money
If the purse is fat that's where it's at
Some fellas like the way they walk
The way they swing and sway
Some fellas like the way they talk
Dig the things they say
I don't care if they wobble like a
or talk with a lisp
I still think I'm a good lover
if the dollar bills are crisp
First I look at the purse
First I look at the purse
First I look at the purse
First I look at the purse
I don't care if you got yourself a wrap
all I want is your pretty green cash
Bought me a suit bought me a car
Want me to look like a Hollywood star

By Andy AWhen they 1st met he swept her off her feet
with a boyish smile acting so sweet
They talked alotgot along really well
little did she knowshe was entering his hell
Her love grew stronger with every day
She'd always wish he'd never change in any way
as time passed on he started to change
The innocence left himhe was becoming so strange

Her love is innocence
he took her by surprise
her love is innocence
in her weakness he prides
her love is innocence
love will always be blind
her love is innocence
trying to break from his bind

things were going great
he was liked by her friends
he made her happy
she never wanted it to end
the days went by
and the closer they got
in her open heart
she gave him a special spot
perfect in others eyes
if they'd only known more
like what went on behind his closed doors
he hid it well by trying to act so cute
scared for herself she had to remain mute
with his short temper he was always ready to snap
with no conscience he'd set up his trap
she always kept quietscared of what he might do
he made her sick left her black and blue

she tried to leave but she was scared of his threats
he was relentless and he never had any regrets
he'd push her around and then laugh in her face
held her at knifpoint to show her his place
wheres that sweet boy
she had met years before
she didn't understand as he knocked her to the floor
she picked herself up and left him behind
all he has left
is his warped and twisted mind
you like to mock us but don't you know
you're just like the restyou're society's clone
and just like a product on a shelf
you can be bought or you can be sold

But your negative reaction
won't bring me down
No matter what you say or do
I'll keep standing my ground
You love to point fingers and yet just the same
whats unique about you when you're a pawn in a game
just like a windowfront mannequin
your face has no identifiable name

I don't agree with how you thinkyou tell me I'm not right
you judge the book by the cover without a peek inside
You've got an ignorant answer for everything I do
you've got a chip on your shoulder and a bad attitude
He was a young boy in school
all the kids played him a fool
a quiet boy no friends at all
he tried to fit but still felt small
Fucked up familynowhere to turn
Kept his feelings insidesoon he'd learn
this boy was always left alone
maybe things would be OK if someone had known

Pushed to the limit
with nowhere to go
what did they do to make this boy blow
Pushed to the limit
what a surprise
this quiet lonely boyand 5 kids have died
Everyday he was pushed even more
holding it in his hatred soared
The kids at school hurting his pride
everyone ignored himpushed him aside
They called him a loser knocked him around
all of 'em pushed him to the ground
He tried to defend himself and failed
til one day the thoughts in his mind prevailed

Next day at school he had a gun
kids continued pushing and making fun
not knowing what he had planned
they didn't notice the gun in his hand
Victims of their own demise
one by one he stared in their eyes
He pulled the gun and shot 'em all
and laughed to himself as he watched em fall
We see her cum around
Looking like a busted hound
She cums to all the shows
Ready to take off her clothes
For any guy in a band
As her pride slips her hand
She's got crabs
She's got the drip
She's a whore
She's damaged goods
She's got herpes
She's got aids
She's got it all
She's damaged goods
She always walks down the street
Acting like she's so sweet
But the truth we all know
She's nothing but an easy ho
If she only understood that
All she is is damaged goods
She's a loose legged bitch
She only comes around to suck dick
Guys get her with ease
As she spreads a nasty disease
She should be tested 'cause
She must be infestedKnew you from school Over seven years
Never heard of nothing Graduated StudentCouncil queer
Now you wanna hang
Got a skinhead boy to show all her friends
She's an Oi Toy
Oi Toy Oi Toy
You never knew shit
Oi Toy Oi Toy
When you gonna quit
Wears Fred Perry's and flight patches too
Doc Marten boots instead of her old trendy shoes
Kisses ass to hang with the girls at the shows
All the Oi music she thinks she knows
High School talk shit is her game
Thinking that her lies will gain her fame
Oi toy Oi toy
Never knew shit
Oi toy Oi toy
When you gonna quitI was young and so naive
wearing my heart on my sleeve
and so I gave it to you
now left in pieces like broken jewels
you just up and left me here
for rotgut gin and cheap beer
but I'm over crying and into fits
sad to see you go you piece of shit

I have a wicked heart because of you
now hate is all that I can do
I have a wicked heart because of you
now hate is all I'll ever do
endless tears I cried for years
your endless bottoms of empty beers
smiling with your drink in hand
to think I once called you a real man
i was always 2nd best but what could I do
when you loved a bottle and I loved YOU

it makes me sick to think I cared
knowing you were never there
and you'll go on what will you be
never again a part of me
with empty hearts and open hands
you will hold your tainted stance
remember me when you fall apart
because you gave me this wicked heart
you preach with such conviction
but your life mirrors contradiction
daddy foots the bills
as you live a life of priveleged frills
buying hair dye with mommy's visa card
yet you bitch that life is so hard
with a punkerthanthou attitude
you hide behind a facade to elude

You're a simple book to read
with your transparent creed
Your facade recedes
to your frontwe do heed
sent to an ivy league school
only to come out a corporate fool
one day sporting daddy's benz
next day your politipunk stance condescends
your opinions are ineffectual
you're a phoney pseudointellectual
out to prove yourself with verbal affrays
but your prescence here is just a phase

you make attempts to theorize
with motives contrived to criticize
you'll find ways to falsly justify your guise
to explain to yourself your lies
you'll be gone in two yearsan accurate prediction
and elsewhere you'll live out a life of fiction
family money affords your fleeting radical views
but nothing can buy you true virtues


I won't say sorry for what I've done
I won't say sorry for having fun
I won't take the blame
And I ain't gonna be ashamed
I won't say sorry for what I've done
I won't say sorry for having fun
Shout it out
Shout it out
I don't give a damn 'cause I'm proud of what I am
I don't give a damn 'cause I'm proud of what I am
I won't say sorry to you
If you think I will You know what you can do and
I won't apologize
And I won't put up with any of your lies
I won't say sorry to you
You can stuff that where you want to
Shout it out
Shout it out
I don't give a damn 'cause I'm proud of what I am
I don't give a damn 'cause I'm proud of what I am
I won't say sorry for the way I act
I won't say sorry for it and that is a fact
I won't say sorry at all
I won't say sorry 'cause it makes me feel small

I won't say sorry for it and that's a fact
Shout it out
Shout it out
I don't give a damn 'cause I'm proud of what I am
I don't give a damn 'cause I'm proud of what I amI hate hip hop kids I hate their fucking noise
I hate the hip hop girls and i hate the hip hop boys
They want to stare you down when you're walking down the street
They want to have a laugh because your style doesn't meet
Hip hop music what a laugh god i hope that shit won't last
Baggy clothes fucked up limp they think its cool to act like a pimp
I hate hip hop girls
I hate hip hop boys
I hate hip hop kids
I hate hip hop noise
Way of life there is no pride
Who fuckin cares if tupac died
I don't care white or black this song is not a racial attack
But i will still have my say hip hop kids go away
Work a day of life most of them have never heard of that
Government check parents sitting home getting fat
Don't give a fuck what you've got to say
Always with an attitude when they pass they feel you should payHere you come looking to fight
making sure to ruin the night
thinking everyones full of fear
when really no one wants you here
coming to shows in a pack
you have to make sure you have back
i look and see how pathetic you are
the way you live you won't get far

You travel in packs 'cause' you can't fight alone
You travel in packsall of eachother's clones
You travel in packsyou have small dicks
You travel in packsyou make me sick
Knock him down kick him in the face
all of you one steady pace
look at thatyou made him bleed
Off of this is how you feed
call your friends to come around
so you can knock him to the ground
you're all ready to attack
just as long as he's held back

Look and see the people you harrass
then when confronted you'll kiss ass
you have a different view everytime
and you'll never be a friend of mine
what the fuck are you're politics
you like keeping them a secret
You say its about American pride
get off the fence and pick a side

All of you with something to prove
always ready to make a move
but you know if it's one on one
you would be the first to run
I think its funny when you act tough
you'll all leave when it gets rough
how do you think you're cool
when we all know that your a bunch of fools
Coppers in Force
Coppers are out in force tonight
Better look out better keep em in sight
Don't know what they'll bust us for
Doesn't really matter you'll be out the door
Coppers are out
Coppers are out
Coppers are out in force tonight
Piss on them for the shit they cause
Fuck 'em all for their fucked up laws
Doesn't matter what you say
You're always on the wrong
And now it's your time to payA grey sky falls on bloodsoaked land where children used to play
theres no more laughter in the airits all been blown away
The bodies burn in the sun as you just march on by
so handsome in your unifroms but you bat not an eye

Like animals
guntoting freaks
crackedup in cami
minds so weak
possesed like zombies in the night
all you want's to kill and fight

your politics and policies have left children without families
but you can't wash the blood from your hands
and giving you the 'right to kill'
and a loaded gun will not make you a man
Like lifesized GI Joe's you goprogrammed to kill
trained to massacre other human beings at will
so well trained with guns aimedyou rip 'em up with no remorse
you don't hesitate to pull the triggerit's just a matter of course


Your minds poisoned to think it just
to leave children dead in the dust
Oh my soldier hero Bodies 'round the place
when it's time to come home how can you look me in the face
The body count rises your conscience falls
but you don't even care at all
You pick out some friends and to them you'll cling
Then you wait and see who next week will bring
You choose your friends wisely to take you to the top
you climb the social ladder and don't know when to stop

Suck 'em in and spit them out
thats what you're all about
The time will come won't be long
people will notice somethings' going wrong
Shit on people and they soon will see
you have a pseudopersonality
You stumbled into punk and saw your way in
doing anything you could to fit in
You lead people on and they fall in your trap
you get what you need and you leave them flat

You're outta control and all I've got to say
is what goes around comes around one day
One step at a time you're knocking people down
look at your noseits turning brown

It won't be long just wait and see
people are gonna' notice how fake you can be
Their gonna' realize you're nothing but a fluke
stop what you're doingyou're making people puke
There used to be a time when I thought you were a friend
There used to be a time when the fun would never end
Here one day gone the next
Forget the past it's the best bet
Friendly faces turned insane
Don't take it personally it was them who changed
Disappointed in every way every time i see you
you turn away
Disappointed in every way every time I see you
you don't know what to say
Every time i see you it's a different way to be
The way i look at you the way you look at me
You piss me off with the way you are
What a disappointment even though i'm so far
away is where i want to live
Because I always knew you had nothing to give
Chance after chance to be a man
You let me down and this is how I stand
I don't understand the things you do
I don't understand what you're trying to prove
To a later day I hold the future
But I know that nothing good will suit youEach day I dig my own grave
In hopes my sanity will be saved
After everyone and everything has let me down
I sink into the sorrow that holds me a slave
In a crowded room screaming
Just help me please
They turn a deaf ear as I fall to my knees
Just help me please

These are years of anger and frustration
Ive become a victim of my own vindication
With lack of trust I left my brain away from me outside
I go in my thoughts that is where i hide
Though they'll forget what they have done throughout these horrid years
I count the number of days
I will not forget my tears
Everyday I bite my tongue
So my wasted words dont hurt noone
After everything ive loved has been taken from me
The lonely mess pulls me into oblivion
In a crowded room screaming
Just help me please
They turn a deaf ear as I fall to my knees
Just help me please

A lie is left of memories of my unhappy past
I try to not to hold on to them but they keep fading fast
Damn these scars youve given me
They will forever last
Sitting in his office behind his desk
Harvard badge on the wall thinks he's the best
A smile on his face to seem like he cares
I'm just another troubled youth holding back her tears
What do you see when you're looking at me
Mr School Psychology
You haven't said nothing to make me see
Mr School Psychology
He brings you inside as he closes the door
Just another statistic to even the score
He asks his question he asks you to reply
When its all said and done it was you who feels defied
What do you see when you're looking at me
Mr School Psychology
You haven't said nothing to make me see
Mr School Psychology
Went to school day after day
Got plenty of looks but they got nothing to say
Plenty of friends known long years ago
No longer speak cause you're no more part of the show
What do you see when you're looking at me
Mr School Psychology
You haven't said nothing to make me see
Mr School Psychology
Mr yeah Mr school
Mr yeah Mr school
Mr yeah Mr school
Mr school psychology
Fuck youBoy with no name he was only 18
Never lughed to much
Hated the monarchy
Yes he hated the queen
Real antisocial and he acted real mean
Was he in a dream
Dowsing her lights was in
In his dreams
Rumpa rumpa rumpa hey hey
Rumpa rumpa
Rumpa rumpa rumpa hey hey
Rumpa rumpa
So full of hate and full of fury
To tell you a story
You would say
He was a one man jury
Catalogue of anger posted through your door
Your door your door your door
A chance would come to even the score
Stole a gun and he stole a car
Oh boy oh boy
With a pretty doll he would go far
Down to london where the bright lights are
Lights are lights are lights are
And i say
The mission his decisionViolence isn't an answer to problems you've got
But people sure use the excuse here a lot
If you don't like someone or how they look
Show 'em your hatred with a left hook
How silly is this shitits making me sick
Ruining fun by acting like pricks
I look around and see so much gone wrong
How much longer can this crap go on

Has everyone all gone crazy
I think everyone's all gone crazy
Has everyone all gone crazy
I think I'm goinggoneCRAZY
You pay eights bucks to get into the show
But it gets cut off early 'cause there's a fightway to go
I'm tired of calling it an early night
Because some tough bonehead went picking a fight
Someone once called your friend you now call a foe
So you even the score by striking a blow
This petty nonsense is giving punk a bad name
And hooligans like you are putting good kids to shame

How many more kids do you have to drop
How many more venues will close before this stops
How many more good times must come to a halt
You can't even answer 'cause' you know you're at fault
We all know it's like a game
Pieces of flesh involved in pain
Day after day same old thing
Try different lives but always the same
Have the time of your lives
One more day 'till another dies
We all know it's bound to come
But who would have guessed the other side would have won
Playing life like a movie everone's got their role
Some make it big the others pay the toll
Time has come to stay alive
Annihilation of our kind
The scene is dying maybe its dead
Just another fucker you wanna kick in the head
Try to find piece of mind
Keep on trying its hard to find
People fuck you over the first chance they get
Never trust no one my mind is set
Believe what you will try believing in me
I'll tyr to take you ther to make you see
Stop the bull shit enough is enough
Try to be so hard but I called your bluffNever to be happy seems the way it's meant to be
Violence all around me Now violence part of me
Chosen few get to have it all
While the rest of us always take the fall
We get shit for our dreams
Shit for our love
Shit for our jobs and
Shit for who we are
Shit for our dreams
Shit for our love
Shit for our future and
Shit for who we are
There's nothing here left why can't you see
Everything I've had you've taken from me
Hope for a future future for what
An upper class job raping the buck
We get shit for our dreams
Shit for our love
Shit for our jobs and
Shit for who we are
Shit for our dreams
Shit for our love
Shit for our family and
Shit for who we are
I don't what's right for me
I don't what I'm supposed to be
All I know is for those I care for best
Take what you can never settle for less
I'll be okay I've done it all before
Just another breather to be going back for more
We get shit for our dreams
Shit for our love
Shit for our jobs and
Shit for who we are
Shit for our dreams
Shit for our love
Shit for our family and
Shit for who we are
SHIT FOR DREAMSOne person talks alot of shit and everyone listens
another speaks the truth and no one cares
the scene is nothing but blank stares
no one has a mind of their own

What happened to the music
I can't hear it
What happened to the unity
I can't see it
What's happened to the scene It's all lies
The lies are spreading fast like a nasty disease
the kids are gonna' agree just to appease
you're all full of shit and I don't care
You can take your rumours and shove 'em up your ass

Who are you to judgeyou're not a king
Sit on your throne but you'll be alone
Don't let your ego soar 'cause' no ones listening
you're gonna' be the one who's left behind

This whole things gonna' blow up in your face
Everyones gonna' realize you're a disgrace
you think you've got the scene by the collar
But people will realize and stop being followers

You think you've got the scene under your wing
but things aren't always as they seem
it's slipping from your fingers as I speak
You're gonna' realize your way too weak
We sat in the Korova Milkbar making up our rassoodocks with what to do with the evening a flip dark chill winter bastard though dry What they sold there was milk plus something else They had no licence for selling liquor but there was no law yet against prodding some of the new veshches which they used to put into the old moloko so you could peet it with vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom or one or two other veshches which would give you a nice quiet horrorshow fifteen minutes admiring Bog And All His Holy Angels And Saints in your left shoe with lights bursting all over your mozg
There were three devotchkas sitting at the counter all together but there were four of us malchicks and it was usually like all for all and one for one These sharps were dressed in the heigth of fashion too with purple and green and orange wigs on their gullivers each one not costing less than three or four weeks of those sharps' wages I should reckon and makeup to match rainbows round their glazzies that is and rots painted very wide Then they had long black very straight dresses and on the groody part of them they had little badges of the like silver with different malchicks names on them Joe and Mike and such like They were supposed to be the names of different malchicks they'ed spattered with before they were fourteen
There was a dinary starry schoolmaster type vec with glasses on his rot and taraguchi hair He looked a milanky bit poogly
What the fuck does poogly mean
I dunno But this Anthony Burgess guy sure seems to like itAnd I snatched her away from the jaws of the world
but I drank up her oceans and dried up her pearls
I acted reprehensibly
I acted like she was sent here for me
We go into the water
and under the water
and a wretched man gave his lovely daughter
from a life of decency
to half a thief like me
And I would saw off my limbs for a little bit more
I would trust you but trust is such a dirty word
I would saw off my limbs for a little bit more
I loved you but love is like a dirty whore
And I snatched her away from the jaws of the world
but I drank up her diamonds and dried up her pearls
I acted reprehensibly
I acted like she was made for me
We go into the water
and under the water
and baptized with the neighbor's daughter
from a life of decency
she saved a wretch like me
And I would saw off my limbs for a little bit more
I would trust you but trust is such a dirty word
I would saw off my limbs for a little bit more
I loved you but love is like a dirty whoreyou've got a porblem I'm so sick of you
your always tellin' me what to do
i'm not perfect i know my flaws
but your not going to be the one to lay down my laws
just because we don't see eye to eye
that dosen't mean i'll take your fuckin' lies

one sided society
don't believe in the same thing your left out you see
one sided society
point a finger at your self before you piont it at me
before you accuse me take a look at your self
you've got the problem here not anyone else
i don't need them and i don't need you
so what the fuck are you trying to prove
Oh it's hard to resist
on a night like this
impossible to withstand
when you're holding my heart in your hand
lay down where ever you please
under the moon cloud masterpeice
may our conscience be devoured
by the sweetness of the hour
meet me down the primrose path
give me life and take some back
oh how I love that song
will you play it again
pour your blue tides on
several soul girlfriends
our love is sweeter than
The Oblivion
Now I know you got your mind
set on somebody else
I was going to let you down
I was kidding myself
Oh how I paid for past mistakes
how blessed is the flesh that breaks
now are you wide awake
just one more time for old times sake
meet me down the primrose path
give me life and take some back
oh how I love that song
will you sing it again
pour your blue tides on
several soul girlfriends
our love is bigger than
The OblivionIt goes ashes to ashes
from dawn 'til dusk
I am drowning in rivers
and oceans of lust
oh sweet lamb of god
whose side are you on
oh sweet mother of pearl
I will kill that goddamn girl
And it's driving me to drink
and it's causing me to think
you're not alone
So where did you go
you're breathing so and so
where the hell have you gone
I've been asleep on your front lawn
I pick up your phone
I know you hiding there at home
And come on stop stop your crying
cause I know that you been lying to me
And it's driving me to drink
and it's causing me to think
you're not alone
I would lay you down
Upon fields of green
under the biggest sky
you've ever seen
Caria madre de Dios 
How the hell can you just leave us
sweet mother of pearl
wont' you give me back my girl
And it's driving me to drink
and it's causing me to think
you're not aloneThere is no moon reflecting in your eyes
no romantic midnight skies
no motive to diguise
It's not your man that you're dreaming of
your heart couldn't care enough
you're too tired to be in love
You want to know what's that god awful sound
something's dragging on the ground
the machine is breaking down
and you never asked for more than you deserved
no shallow poetic words
from a song you've never heard
and it's not your man
It's nobodies fault
sometimes these things come to a screeching hault
regretful of the past
you know these things won't last
a life time gone so fast
these things will never last
It's not your man that you're dreaming of
your heart couldn't care enough
you're too tired to be in loveLove is like a paradise
with rumors flying and sacrifices
laid out before your eyes
underneath the big city skies
in the moonlight in the moonlight
she looked alright to me
In the moonlight in the moonlight
came up so tragically
We say
who let all the light in here
who let all the light in here
why's it so bright in here
who let all the light in here
I'd chew my own heart out
I'd chew my own arm off
I'd chew my own heart out for you
And we're shooting in the hoops courts
and swimming in the asfalt
and we're going straight to jail
yeah we're going straight to hell for this
I saw sunrise down on Cicero
with the dragqueens and the dirty old whores
we had it going on last night
we were all down here last night
where the hell were you
who let all the light in here
who let all the light in here
why's it so bright in here
who let all the light in here
I'd chew my own heart out
I'd chew my own arm off
I'd chew my own heart out for youI'll go away 'til there's nooe around
Leave your house when the sun goes down
plant myself at the first bar I see
pour a thousand drinks and dream
You'll be gone for one more day
I'll watch you slip falling further away from us
You were right this place is haunted
change the locks we are unwanted
drown me in your heart shaped locket
store me in your fur coat pocket
You'll be gone for one more year
I'll watch you slip falling further away from hereThe end it shouldn't end like this
it's the bottle she is merciless
she's stringing me along
she's stringing me along
And how could such a palace house
deceit and malice
there's something wrong here
there's something wrong here
As the words were chosen
his heart was frozen
his sould had spoken
but it sounded all twisted and broken
Years and years ago
they delivered the final blow
and suddenly his life ain't a damn
There were ghosts
and they lit up this town
but they left
when they sold off the underground
we ain't welcome here no more
As the words were chosen
his heart was frozen
his sould had spoken
but it sounded all twisted and broken
I I won't let you down
it's my first day back in town
but my skin is six feet underground
and everything is different now
The end it shouldn't end like this
it's the bottle she is merciless
she's stringing me along
she's stringing me along again
As the words were chosen
his heart was frozen
his sould had spoken
but it sounded all twisted and brokenHold your grandmother's Bible to your breast
Gonna put it to the test
You want it to be blessed
And in your heart
You know it to be true
You know what you gotta do
They all depend on you
And you already know
Yet you already know how this will end
There is no escape
From the slavecatchers' songs
For all of the loved ones gone
Forever's not so long
And in your soul
They poked a million holes
But you never let'em show
C'mon it's time to go
And
You
Already know
Yeah you already know
How this will end
Now you've seen his face
And you know that there's a place
In the sun
For all that you've done
For you and your children
No longer shall you need
You always wanted to believe
Just ask and you'll receive
Beyond your wildest dreams
And
You
Already know
Yeah you already know
How this will end
You already know 
You already know 
You already love will endSweetheart
How I miss your heart
Beating next to mine
The right words
Were always hard to find
When all our time was fine
When darling you were mine all mine
And I know I know you had no choice
But I how I miss your voice
Singing right with mine
Flesh of my flesh
Soul of my soul
I come back home
All this darkness cannot hurt us
Cause they made you from the light
Here on birthplace don't be nervous
You will make it through this night
Sweetheart
How I miss your heart
Beating next to mine
Flesh of my flesh
Soul of my soul
I come back homeRaise your glasses please into a toaste
For we are merely home town ghosts
And it's been all over the floor
What the hell are you saving it for
Oh June July August September
Let's drink 'em all
I don't want to remember
These have been the best years of our lives
It's a shame my dears
There's no room for lost years
So we're leaving
We're leaving
We're leaving tonight
You look lovely lying wasted on the bed
staring at a photograph of you and your best friends
they said make a cross over your heart
and swear we'll never drift apart
It's a shame my dear
to be leaving you here
but we're leaving
we're leaving
we're leaving tonight
oh my hero's my lovers where have you gone
there is somthing in the air something is wrong
where is my father my mother my sister my lovers
have you all gone over to the other side
It's a shame my dears
There's no room for me here
so I'm leaving

This love of which we sing
What are we doing
What are we doing
And I will give you anything
Just please dont stop singing
The world would stop spinning

Upon your pretty wings

But you only love me
You only love me when Im leaving
You only love me cause Im leaving
You only love me cause Im leaving
You only love me when Im leavingTheyre just words they aint worth nothing
Cloud your head and push your buttons
And watch how they just disappear
When were far away from here
And everybody knows where this is heading
Forgive me for forgetting
Our hearts irrevocably combined
Starcrossed souls slow dancing
Retreating and advancing
Across the sky until the end of time
Oh who put all those cares inside your head
You cant live your life on your deathbed
And its been such a lovely day
Lets not let it end this way
And everybody knows where this is heading
Forgive me for forgetting
Our hearts irrevocably combined
Starcrossed souls slow dancing
Retreating and advancing
Across the sky until the end of time
Like sisters and brothers we lean on each other
Like sweethearts carved on a headstone
Oh why even bother itll be here tomorrow
Its not worth it sleeping alone
And look at you and me still here together
There is no one knows you better
And weve come such a long long way
Lets put it off for one more day
And everybody knows where this is heading
Forgive me for forgetting
Our hearts irrevocably combined
Starcrossed souls slow dancing
Retreating and advancing
Across the sky until the end of timeMass halucination on the ballroom floor
and an ancient rite of passage on the shit house door
you keep stealing all my cigerettes
and your whiskey breath
is drowning out the words you're saying
but go ahead get 'em off your chest
And I feel it in the marrow of my lazy bones
your on to something better
and there's always someone better
Did I drag you down
Did I drag you down
Don't let me drag you down here to my level
that ain't no good
that ain't no good
that ain't no good
Well here I go again
you've heard it all before
but I only caught a glimpse
can I see a little more
they give it all and give it up
it ain't never enough
when you're deaf and dumb and blind with love
And I can see down to the bottom of your big blue eyes
You're on to something better
and there's always someone better
Did I drag you down
Did I drag you down
Don't let me drag you down here to my level
that ain't no good
that ain't no good
that ain't no goodWell this is one place where
Your gods can't dwell
It's like walking in
To the mouth of hell
Sweating our dignities out on the subway
At the beginning of another long long day
As for my mortal remains
I couldn't care
'Cause when the day is done
She'll be waiting here
That's when I love the accommodations
In a urine smelling transit station
I'll move these rocks
For you my love
I will tear them up out of the Earth
And I will bend my spine
'Til it's quitting time
'Cause I know what your time is worth
And I'll give my days to the Neanderthals
With the classic rock
And the wrecking ball
I'll go swimming in the wet concrete
And I'll cast my pearls at the unpaved streets
I don't mind the mental atrophy
'Cause when the lids come down you're all I see
You're like a lovely hallucination
You get me through my current occupation
I'll move these rocks
For you my love
I will tear them up out of the Earth
And I will bend my spine
'Til it's quitting time
'Cause I know what your time is worth
See I'm towering
Above mortal men
I'll emerge from the darkness
And there you stand
You're the Queen of all the surface streets
I'm a wiener boy that you're here to meet
I don't need the money
I couldn't care
'Cause everything I want Is standing right here
I would live on the street
In a cardboard shack
Just to worship your feet
And the curve of your back
You'll be my only preoccupation
On a permanent vacation
Now I will move these rocks
For you my love
I will tear them up out of the Earth
And I will bend my spine
'Til it's quitting time
'Cause I know what your love is worth
What your love is worth
What your love is worthIn the sharp gust of love
My memory stirred
When time wreathed a rose
A garland of shame
Its thorn my only delight
War torn afraid to speak
We dare to breathe
Majestic
Imperial
A bridge of sighs
Solitude sails
In a wave of forgiveness
On angels' wings
Reach out your hands
Don't turn your back
Don't walk away
How in the world
Can I wish for this
Never to be torn apart
Close to you
'Til the last beat
Of my heart
At the close of day
The sunset cloaks
These words in shadowplay
Here and now long and loud
My heart cries out
And the naked bone of an echo says
Don't walk away
Reach out your hands
I'm just a step away
How in the world
Can I wish for this
Never to be torn apart
Close to you
'Til the last beat
Of my heartlay low

Calling up so late at night
Assuming that i can get this right

I stumble home alone
You're knocked out
That was just the liquor talking
Please don't answer
'Cause it's mister disaster
I'm sorry when i say that i'm feeling really bad about it
I've been writing novels on your wall
And now your phone has ten missed calls
Wish i was in your bed but i'm drinking with my friends
Without you
It frustrates me
I know we're done but stil can't let you be
I'm such an idiot
Why is it i can't get you off my mind tonight
Please don't answer
'Cause it's mister disaster

And now your phone has ten missed calls
Wish i was in your bed but i'm drinking with my friends
Without you
Without youIt's not the weather that's making me shiver its all
The arguments the shit that he gives her
Oh I know
If it were up to me
She'd never be unhappy
She truly has the looks to kill
About as rare as a two dollar bill
I wish that she would read between the lines
What's up with these games
He treats like she doesn't mean anything
She can be so sweet
Why doesn't she see what's happening
I'm being dragged down by the drama
I'm being dragged down
It's not the weather that's making me bitter
It's the
The way I feel when I see him kiss her
Why don't you realize you're fooling yourself
Why don't you realize
She truly has the looks to kill
About as rare as a two dollar bill
I hope someday she'll read between the lines
What's up with these games
He treats like she doesn't mean anything
She can be so sweet
Why doesn't she see what's happening
He's an intricate liar
And I'm wrapped up with desire
The fact of the matter it's just lust and not love
I'm being dragged down by the drama
I'm being dragged down 
I'm being dragged down by the drama
I'm being dragged down
Baby look at all the signs
You need to read between the lines
Baby look at all the signs
You need to read between the lines
What's up with these games
He treats like she doesn't mean anything
She can be so sweet
Why doesn't she see what's happening
He's an intricate liar
And I'm wrapped up with desire
The fact of the matter it's just lust and not love
This whole thing makes me shiver
More than more than
I would I would
Through a
Chicago winter
I'm being dragged down by the drama
I'm being dragged downGirl you broke the record
For breaking hearts
I'm sick of all the lying
When I lie alone at night
Gimme me back
Gimme back those nights
When I thought you were only mine
Whose lips were lucky that night
Where did you go
When you broke my heart
I broke into your apartment
To get my shit
And wreck the place for the hell of it
I'm not surprised that most your friends are guys
Because you use them left and right
Yeah
You used me left and right
I can't believe I bought it
This is never what I wanted
Gimme back
Gimme back those nights
When I thought you were only mine
Whose lips were lucky that night
Where did you go
When you broke my heart
I broke into your apartment
To get my shit
And wreck the place for the hell of it
Where did you go
When you broke my heart
I broke into your apartment
To get my shit
And wreck the place for the hell of it
Where did you go
Where did you go

Where did you go
When you broke my heart
I broke into your apartment
And wrecked your stuff
You should have thought twice when you fucked this up
Where did you go
When you broke my heart
I broke into your apartment
To get my shit
And wreck the place for the hell of it
YeahI'm still awake

Like I'm some fool from a film
I waited many nights don't wait anymore she said
But what if I did
Do you think that I been sleeping here alone
Crying waiting on a ring
See I don't dig those kind of blues anymore she said
So what if I did
Is that an invitation to use my love in your man's man's world
But maybe I'll be the one to roll you over
I'll call when I wanna call you honey magnolia
And I'll be the one to let you know when the sweet taste is gone
And it's over honey magnolia
I spent so many nights just blowin' in the wind
Sleepin' in the shirt that you wore
I used to race this town cryin' in the night she said
I don't cry anymore
Maybe they're lining up to take you back in your man's man's world
Maybe I'll be the one to roll you over
I'll call when I wanna call you honey magnolia
And I'll be the one to let you know when the sweet taste is gone
And it's over honey magnolia
Maybe I'll be the one to roll you over
I'll call when I wanna I'll call you honey magnolia
And I'll be the one to let you know when the sweet taste is gone
And it's over
Baby I'll the one you'll never get over
The thorn in your pride sweet honey magnolia
And maybe I'll come running at the end of the night
When you're older honey magnoliaI could take my time and I can speed you up
I could pull you in you can't get enough
Let's go slipsliding in my veins
'Cause this life is only chains
It's nothing like the colors in my dreams
I just wanted to be Steve McQueen
And my horses of English racing green
You and me in British racing green
And it could hold us down
They can break your pride
And if it gets too rough well you just climb inside
Let's go slipsliding in my veins
'Cause this life is only chains
It's nothing like the colors in my dreams
I just want to be Steve McQueen
With my horses of English racing green
You and me in British racing green
And don't you know that you and I we're never going home
And since we don't wanna be alone
Here we go sliding in my veins
'Cause this life is only chains
It's nothing like the colors in my dreams
And I just wanted to be Steve McQueen
With my horses of English racing green
You and me in British racing green
'Cause this life is always the same
It's nothing like the colors in our dreams
We just wanted to be Steve McQueen
With our horses of English racing green
You and me in British racing green
You and me Steve McQueenI built a room for you in the back of my mind
Where the ravenous wolves and the ghosts I know reside
You were amazing you were always on my mind
We were secrets to keep crows buried sidebyside
But we tasted a kiss that was sent from below
It was cool in the night I was old as a stone
In the back of a car with a child at heart
Who suddenly showed you their teeth
But you say I'm alright
Baby I don't mind
I'll get on just fine
On them long long drives
I keep a letter you wrote before the devil came in the picture
Says I've got you now wrapped around my finger
And into the mystic we were blue and outrageous
And every night I would race the Moon and fall for you
'Cause you ache for a drug a that'll never be enough
You're never gonna feel like when he first picked you up
When he drove you around bought you powder and flowers
Until the thrill was gone
But you said I'm alright
Baby I don't mind
I'll get on just fine
On them long long drives
Last night I remembered being seventeen
I met a girl with a taste for the world and whiskey and rites of spring
Spent every night with cassettes that she liked
In a car that I borrowed a lot
And I could never get her to believe
But you said I'm alright
Baby I don't mind
I'll get on just fine
On them long long drives
Because I'm alright
Janie I don't mind
I'll get on just fine
On them long long drives without you
Without you
Without you
Drives without youMost of this life's been a drag of a high
And lows like a blow in a paid thrown title fight
Most of my sins were born in a kiss on a night like this
Calling all lonely hearts
Don't you want a life like we saw on the picture show
So come on give me something come on keep me up all night
You say my baby all this time in between drives me crazy
I want a life on fire going mad with desire
I don't wanna survive I want a wonderful life
My love seems that it goes from a dream
To a crash and a roll just shaking up everyone
Maybe there's more than the treasures we secure
That become heavy chains to sink us in tidal waves
And all I could do is take you from the circus show
So come on give me something come on keep me up all night
You say my baby all this time in between drives me crazy
I want a life on fire going mad with desire
I don't wanna survive I want a wonderful life
And all my nights they always end the same 
Coming from behind
It's just the ageold game from the living dead buzzing in my head
They keep me up all night
You say my baby all this time in between drives me crazy
I want a life on fire going mad with desire
I don't wanna survive I want a wonderful life

I want a wonderful lifeAnd I lost my mind in the middle of Toronto I was
Spending nights at home full throttle I was
Breakin' your heart
Breakin' my heart revenge
And I feel just like I woke up in somebody else's skin
Who else is gonna remind you to take a picture of them
Well they brought hearts and daggers they wrote songs about you
When they tied you up in the rungs of ladders
And you never ended up coming home you just
Became something like some smoke that I tried too hard to hold
And when I awoke everything had changed you see I
Left my home returned something different I was
Beaten to death bleeding to death with regret
And nobody else can see it
But there's something underneath my skin
And I wish I could tell you
I had the worst little dream
Well they brought hearts and daggers they wrote songs about you
When they tied you up in the rungs of ladders
And you never ended up coming home you just
Became something like some smoke that I tried too hard to hold
And the black clouds came
And darkened all our insides there were
Newspaper clippings with horrible headlines
Of doom and despair and your name and my name said
Who will save you from the truth of the matter
That your love though like gold is gone
Well they brought hearts and daggers they wrote
Songs about her when they
Tied you up in the rungs of ladders
And you never ended up coming home you just
Became something like a dream I saw where they brought
Hearts and daggers they wrote
Songs about you when they
Tied you up and you hung from ladders
And you never ended up coming home you just
Became something like some smoke that I tried too hard to holdHey
I heard you say you don't feel right
Somethin' must've changed inside
She said I still love the bands and the boy down the street
But everybody else gives me the creeps
And there's a hole in you now
Like the windshield was taken out
And everybody's hurt and mine ain't the worst
But it's mine and I'm feelin' it now
Sometimes I think it's haunted inside this house
And I hear ya cryin' over the phone
Where have all the good times gone
Downing the glass of shouting matches
Lost in the songs they don't write anymore
 It's all right I ain't tryin' to bring you down tonight
 Oh my my my she says I don't mind
I'm just so tired of the empty sheets I sleep beside
Heard you say it's gone all wrong since when did the days and the nights get so long
She said I still miss the scene and the dying breed but now I'd settle for some company
And there were things that I did just so I could feel anything
But somewhere along something went off and I woke up with blood on my lips
And yeah and there were nights I just did whatever I liked
And now I hear ya cryin' over the phone
Where have all the good times gone
Downing the glass of shouting matches
Lost in the songs they don't write anymore
But hey hey hey it's all right I ain't tryin' to bring you down tonight
Oh mymy my she said I don't mind I'm just so tired of the empty sheets I sleep beside
And now I hear ya cryin' over the phone
Where have all the good times gone
Downing the glass of shouting matches
Lost in the songs you don't write anymore
But hey hey hey
It's all right I ain't tryin' to bring you down tonight
And oh my my my she said I don't mind
'Cause maybe someday they're gonna love me back to life

My name is Rosemary

You'd be lucky to meet me

My name is Rosemary

Yeah you'd be lucky if you get to hold me
My name is Rosemary and you'd be lucky to meet meFeel you move through this crowded room
And I catch myself like a spell fallen under you
I've been here before
Watching the wheels go round
Everybody that I've ever known
They just ache all night and they wake up alone
Yeah we wait in the dark
For something to put us to sleep
And oh my dear you never know how
'Til the things you've done come and run you down
And we want love like it was a drug
All we wanted was a little relief
And every heart I held in between
They were painkillers to me
They were painkillers to me
And could you be to me a love supreme
'Cause we wait out this life just to hold on to anything
'Cause most of the sparks are just sweet little cherry bombs
Oh my dear don't make a sound
'Till somebody burns you and spits you out
And we want love like it was a drug
All we wanted was a little relief
And every heart I held in between
They were painkillers to me
They were painkillers to me
Use me up 
Yeah and I'll be enough
Come and use me up 
Oh don't you love the way I drag you down
Ain't that enough for you now
Don't you want love like it was a drug
Yea don't you want a little relief
From every heart I held in between
They were painkillers to me
They were painkillers to me
And we want love like it was a drug
Yeah all we wanted was a little relief
And every heart I held in between
They were painkillers to me
They were painkillers to me
Come get your painkillers from meIn all good faith and sentiment
I can't believe somehow
That I haven't died of grief or something
Since you left this town
I'm all undecorated cigarettes
And standard white apartment walls
At three AM and four AM
It's impossible to sleep
I'd do anything to hold you
And feel you next to me
But I'm all sore eyes and beasts
At my back door pulling out their claws
So yes I will take those
Whatever else they give me
If it stops the nightmares
It probably won't kill me
And if I slow it down I'll end up on one of my accusers' knives
So I only stop to tell her that I love her at the red lights
And all in all I'm wrecked you see
From years of piping down
And piping up about the things
That never mattered anyhow
When you change too much you lose yourself
And sometimes you just can't get them back
And you might be an angel or devil I don't know
But if in fact you are now love
Well I've been there before
I've fallen on my face
And I've been burned so near to death I probably won't live through it
Anyhow
So yes I will take those
Whatever else they give me
If it stops the nightmares
It probably won't kill me
And if I slow it down I'll end up on one of my accusers' knives
So I only stop to tell her that I love her at the red lightsLily I don't know how to start this letter
I'm writing you from the beach where I'm living
I got a disco outside of my window
I love all these kids but the good times are killing me
I got a picture of you on the dashboard
So I can feel like you're watching right over me
I hope someday you're gonna move to the city
'Cause the lights in this town they don't brighten up anything
And they say such foolish things like love love love love is all you need
But everything inside is saying 'Danger baby love's gonna leave'
So I played your sympathy have mercy on me
'Cause I been hurt I been stung by the good name of love 'til I threw my own heart in the sea
Among other foolish things
And I don't mind the nights and the low light
We spin 'round like records in the apartment
You still remind me of Marianne Faithfull
Lookin' like a picture taken outta the sixties
And we say such foolish things like 'Love love love love is all we need
But everything inside is saying danger baby love's gonna leave
So I played your sympathy be patient with me
'Cause I been hurt I been stung by the good name of love 'til I threw my own heart in the sea
Among other foolish things
And we believe such foolish things like 'Love love love love is all we need'
And living would be easy if we never ever had to bleed
And I've taken a dive on a smoky set of lies
I been so deceived and I've been the one lyin'
And there was this one time when I painted a masterpiece
Among other foolish thingsSkin and bones you never did come home
Crashing on my heart through the telephone
I remember the tall grass waving
In past lives old poems
I must have lived a lifetime without you
You must've ended up somebody's angel
I remember you loving the radio
New waves and old stones
Hey hey little Tommy gun
I guess we're never gonna end up the lucky ones
If I never see you again
Have a round on me love hallelujah nobody wins
The queen is gone she died from a sad song
I lost most of myself pleasing everyone
I had to learn how to begin again
It's alright move on
Hey hey little Tommy gun
I guess we're never gonna end up the lucky ones
If I never see you again
Have a round on me love hallelujah nobody wins
 but have a round on your friend
 if I never see you again
 have a round on your friend
And hey hey little Tommy gun
I guess we're never gonna end up the lucky ones
And if I never see you again
Have a round on me love hallelujah
And hey hey pretty baby
I still remember you driving me crazy
And if I never see you again
Have a round on me love hallelujah nobody wins
 and nobody wins
 and nobody wins
 if I never see you again
 you can blame it on the windI think my girl got a mojo hand
And all the boys in town want her bad
And none of us can sleep we don't think and we can't eat
Since my girl got a mojo hand
And they all wanna turn her on
And they're climbin' through the windows and the doors
And they're crawlin' in my songs down my halls and in my thoughts
And they all wanna turn her on
But where would I go if you left me on my own
Who could take your place in my soul
I was lost where you came among the tombs among the waves
And if you go honey God only knows
I never heard the horses of war
Did my eyes not see 'em comin' forward
Did I simply wear you down with my nerves up so loud
I never heard the horses of war
But where would I go if you left me on my own
Who could take your place in my soul
I was lost where you came among the tombs among the waves
And if you go honey God only knows
I think my girl caught a mojo hand
And I feel like I'll be goin' back
Back to the beat to haunt the streets of New Orleans
Since my girl caught a mojo hand
But where would I go if you left me on my own
Who could take your place in my soul
I was lost where you came among the tombs among the waves
And if you go honey God only knows
Oh honey God only knows where my heart would blow
With the wind the chilly wind in October
But here I go like a storm
Baby back out on my own
Think I've taken all that I can stand
Since my girl got a mojo handYou can't judge an apple by looking at a tree
You can't judge honey by looking at the bee
You can't judge a daughter by looking at the mother
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
Oh can't you see
Oh you misjudge me
I look like a farmer
But I'm a lover
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
Oh come on in closer baby
Hear what else I gotta say
You got your radio turned down too low
Turn it up
You can't judge sugar by looking at the cane
You can't judge a woman by looking at her man
You can't judge a sister by looking at her brother
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
Oh can't you see
Oh you misjudge me
I look like a farmer
But I'm a lover
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
You can't judge a fish by lookin' in the pond
You can't judge right from looking at the wrong
You can't judge one by looking at the other
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
Oh can't you see
Oh you misjudge me
I look like a farmer
But I'm a lover
You can't judge a book by looking at the coverMy sister's name is Puudin' Tame
They asked if she would stay the same
My brother's name is Little Jack Horner
My mama asked to watch to heat warm them
Sister told papa when he got home
Papa papa he sassed and moaned
Papa looked at brother far in his eyes
Brother started on the hand jive
He called sister and he called mom
Said Look here look here what's this going on
Everybody had a real surprise
But brother had tears in his eyes
Brother's so scared he couldn't walk
Papa's afraid he could not talkI'm sorry
Oh I'm sorry
Oh baby I'm sorry
For the things I said to you
You know I love you
You know I care
With you my new heart I want to share
Darling I need you
With all your heart and soul
To know that I want you and I'll never let you go

This is the tale I heard happened one day
We were playing some Poker an plying some boose
Where any old Hombre could win or lose
Up from the table jumped YOU ALL GREEN
the baddest Hombre you have ever seen
He said no wonder I can't win a hand tonight
Cos that stranger over there from Texas is between me and the light
Want to hear all about me
Just before I do here's my last decree
My name is YOU ALL GREEN I am from New Orleans
I am about the baddest Hombre you have ever seen
I was born in a barn with a Butcher's knife
trouble I love thieves I despise
Wild Horses kicked me in my side and a Rattle snake bit me and crawled off and died
When I was Seven I went to Spain to put the Thunder in cuffs and the Rain in chains
Walked Barbed wire barefoot for miles or more
Seen lying in the Basin there lays the road
Stranger stood up slowwith his Gun hanging low
Spoke with a draw so deep and low
I am YOU ALL GREEN I'm from New Orleans
I'm about the baddest Hombre you have ever seen
His hand flashed to quick for the Human eye
but he was already look down the barrel of a Forty Five
One shot rang out with a Hell of a roar
and the next body lies there on the floor
I am YOU ALL GREEN I am from New Orleans
I about the baddest Hombre you have ever seen

I slowed down see what he said
He hollersa 'Aby any chance are you goin' my way'
I say 'Why sho' baby hop on in and gimme a cigarette'
Just then he reached down in his pockets
And that was the moment I regret
He hollered 'Reach for the sky'
I said 'But I don't understand sir'
'Don't try no monkey business
I've got a stopper in my hand'
And then he saysa 'Alookhere you see this here
I got in my hand this is a 38 pistol built on a 45 frame
Shoots tombstone bullets and a ball and chain'
He said 'Now I ain't tryin' to shake you up'
 'But I just want you to know if the cops
Start to crowd me any you gon' be the first to go'
'So now lookhere don't even look back
You just drive on just like ain't nothin' happenin'
That's what he told me he wouldn't even let me look
Back at nothin'
He say 'When I get to that red light' he wanted me
To go to my left and then jump back to my right
He says 'Nowa I want you to drive up in that alley'
'Uhuh not in that alley that that one over there'
'And cool it behind that liquor sto' and keep a sharp
Lookout at all times while I sneak in that back do'

Be on guard 'cause when he come runnin' out there
Wit' all that money he wanted me to mash on it real hard

The cop pulled up behind me and said
'Move up a little bit man for we wanna take your place'
And then this guy come runnin' outta the sto'
with the money in his hand and said 'Oh there you are'

You're a troubled kind of guy that's why that's why Tell me you can't stay for too long in one place Without a word you'll go running off to someplace Oh oh how you made me cry Oh oh how you made me cry
Till you came back in your own sweet time To kiss away the tears  tell me you're mine mine

Playing from the start
And our love's becoming
The talk of the town
Talking talking talking
All over town
I can't live up to misery and pain
That I'm about to face
My tears would fall like rain

'Cause I happen to know
One day soon you'll let me go
It's gonna hurt it's gonna
Hurt me so inside

Don't want to see my cry
Please don't ever ever say goodbye

Although he may not want me now I'll make him love me

For the dance has gone

Oh Womanizer
Oh You're a Womanizer BabyHere's your letter
And in each line I'll write your love away
And you know say it's better
But sometimes what is honest I can't say
And it's true
I think it's better than before
When I gave you love you wanted more
There's the door
This is useless
How can I explain what needs no words
But you know now you'll lose this
To what's been done you're praying for the words
But it's you and I guess it's better than before

When I gave you love you wanted more

There's the door 'cause I'm on the floor
There's your letter
When you're done I'm saying it once more
'Cause it's true
And I guess it's better than before

When I gave you love you found some more

Cause it's you
And I guess it's better than before

When I gave you love you wanted more

There's the door 'cause I'm on the floor
And there's the door and I'm on the floorTo dispel any rumor
I should do this sooner than later
I had a girl and didn't hate her
But I let her go
I swear that I've got problems
And she can never stop them from ending
My head is fucked up
And I've been pretending
She's the one
How could I let it go on
You wanna hurt someone
That's why I wrote you this song

Kimberly don't cry
I'll always be by your side
Yeah Kimberly don't cry
A broken heart just takes time
Let's take it one step further
I never meant to hurt her so badly
We had a love and I can say madly
Let her go
I couldn't let it go on
Let her know
I put my soul in this song

Kimberly don't cry
I'll always be by your side
Yeah Kimberly don't cry
A broken heart just takes time

Yeah I could shed a thousand tears
But you'd never see them falling
Yeah I could walk a thousand years
But you'd never see me crawling
I've said it before
And I'm saying it one time more

Kimberly don't cry
I'll always be by your side
Yeah Kimberly don't cry 
A broken heart just takes time
Just takes time
Kimberly don't
Kimberly don't
Kimberly don't cry
Kimberly don't cry
A broken heart just takes time
Just takes timeOpen your eyes you're just like I know you
Innocence runs down your face
As hard as I try
I die when I hold you
Guilty I miss my place
Just to be there tonight
You gotta know it's for real
Cause I'll be the man you complete tonight
Just slip away and believe your mine
We've got the time now the rest of our lives
Now you belong to me
Let's leave today we can go anywhere
Show me what few get to feel
I'm not the same but you steal me away
And it's such a fake world you're the one soul that's real
Just to be there tonight 
I'll be the man you complete tonight
Just slip away and believe your mine
We've got the time now the rest of our lives
Now you belong to me
Now you belong to me
Sierra open the door and I'll walk right beside you
My Sierra I'll give you more than a shoulder to cry
To believe there's a place where we both live forever and we'll go
If you'll just take my hand
I'll be the man you complete tonight
Just slip away and believe your mine
We've got the time now the rest of our lives
Now you belong to me
I'll be the man you complete tonight
Just slip away and believe your mine
We've got the time now the rest of our lives
Now you belong to me
I'll be the man you complete
Now you belong to meWhat can I do to make you think that I am just not over you
What can I say to make it right again
Where can I go to take a lost soul and get it safe again
If I don't have you then I'm left alone tonight
Won't you stay stay stay
Don't let this slip away not today
Let you cut me down
You can run around all over town
Just as long as you stay
When did I ever take advantage of your sweet desire
How could you think that I'm so cold to you
Did I freeze you out of every situation
You can drop the cards then I'm gonna fold
Won't you stay stay stay
Don't walk out on me today not today
You can cut me down
You can run around all over town
Just as long as you stay

I won't be a lesson I wouldn't be

When were good then were real good

You take my hand and you steal my heart
And honey hearing that to you was just a start
You can kick me up but you can't break us apart
Won't you stay stay stay
Don't walk out on me today not today
You could cut me down or you could stay stay stay
Don't walk out on me today not today
You could cut me down
You can run around all over town
Just as long as you stay just as long as you stay
Yeah you can run around all over town
You get me up all night
I only wanna make it right
As long as you stayHere I sit in a low lit room
I think I'd like you right on top
All I have is a mind that needs to sink
You're always right on top
Guess if you were around tonight I'd know
I'd ask the questions if you still got it
You still got it
Hey
Here I sit in a place we used to lay
And I'd love you right on top
Now I know like a taste that melts away
One day you'll stop
If you say
I'm scared
It's never right
It's unfair
Was it ever right
It's too bad you're lonely
'Cause I'm alright as long as I'm with you
As long as I'm with you 
Guess your name on a wall I see
Your face too and I just can't stop
Because I know your body your press your taste you waste
When you're not right on top
Guess if you were around tonight I'd think
I'd ask the questions if you still got it
Do you still got it
I'll ask the questions again
Do you still got it
'Cause I got it
If you say
I'm scared
It's never right
It's unfair
Was it ever right
It's too bad you're lonely
'Cause I'm alright as long as I'm with you
You say
It's just goodnight
It's no way
But I can't deny
This once and only
'Cause I'm alright as long as I'm with you
I think that you know
I don't want to want you
All that I need is a better day
I want you to know too you can leave me dry
Can't you leave me tonight
If you say
I'm scared
It's never right
It's unfair
Was it ever right
It's too bad you're lonely
'Cause I'm alright as long as I'm
If you say
I'm scared
It's never right
It's unfair
Was it ever right
It's too bad you're lonely 
'Cause I'm alright as long as I'm with you
You say
It's just goodnight
It's no way
But I can't deny
This once and only 
'Cause I'm alright as long as I'm with you
 As long as I'm with you
 As long as I'm with
 It's too bad you're lonely 
'Cause I'm alright as long as I'm with you
Blank face little girl
Your colors running down
It's the one you love
Cry out my world this copulated kiss
It's the last that you deserve
I've done wrong
I've been gone
It's the one you love
Drink down and your candles burn
Away away
Dreaming you was so easy yeah
If it was up to me then you would cry tonight
If it was up to you
Take you take me away
I can't go with you now
Don't you wish I'd try
Left just a trace it's growing colder still
So kiss yourself goodbye
I've done wrong
I've been gone
It's the one you love
One drink and your candles burn
Away away
Dreaming you was so easy yeah
If it was up to me then you would cry tonight
When it's up to you you kiss yourself goodbye
Let go push your daisies
A thousand maybes a thousand left I'm done
A white glow just for tasting
A life for wasting 
And I look into your eyes it's the one you love
Last one then I fill you up today today

When dreaming you was so easy yeah
If it was up to me then you would cry tonight
When its up to you you kiss yourself goodbye
You would cry tonight 
So kiss yourself goodbye

Yeah you I choose
I look to the stars
For a girl like you
And what I lost I have found
And yeah we'll wait around
For the girl that is you
Yeah
Maybe a chance
I could have with her
We shared a glance
At least I thought we were
And what I lost I have found
And yeah we'll wait around
For the girl that is you
Yeah
You make my heart skip but how
I'm scared
What do I do now
I wanna go out
I'm stuck here all alone
I gotta get out
I'm here all alone
And I'm thinking of you
You're on my mind
I try to talk to you
But you never give me the time of day
I dream of us
And wake up alone
We'll take the bus
But I'm still at home
And what I've done I'll do
And then it's just me and you
And then you leave in May
You leave me hard and lonely
You are my one and only
I wanna go out
I'm stuck here all alone
I gotta get out
I'm here all alone
And I'm thinking of you
You're on my mind
I try to talk to you
But you never give me the time of day
Do  do do do  do do do  do do do do do 
You are
Such a beautiful thing
And all goods things must come to an end
You are

And all goods things must come to an end
It's the end  It's the end  It's the end for you

Do  do do do  do do do  do do do do do Spin round
Tell me what to say
Break down
And no other way
What is it
Is this it
This is it
Back to
I never knew your name
Stick through
Soon after the rain
She shines
How she shines
This is it
And shadows blend one last time 
Your picture speaks on this time 
Cause I been up 3 days
Awake awake
2 more weeks
And I'm turning to fade
The world still turns
What makes sense
Stretch this song to a fever cadence
Up 3 days
Awake awake
2 more weeks
And I'm turning to fade
And all things close
All I wish
Never change these distances
Green eyes
Everything I see
Green skies
If left up to me
And I know
And she knows
This is it
And shadows blend one last time 
Your picture speaks on this time 
'Cause I've been up 3 days
Awake awake
2 more weeks
And I'm turning to fade
The world still turns
What makes sense
Stretch this song to a fever cadence
Up 3 days
Awake awake
2 more weeks
And I'm turning to fade
And all things close
All I wish
Never change these distances
Just be brave
Just listen to me
Your heart gives mine reason to beat
Now
'Cause I've been up 3 days
Awake awake
2 more weeks
And I'm turning to fade
The world still turns
What makes sense
Stretch this song to a fever cadence
Up 3 days
Awake awake
2 more weeks
And I'm turning to fade
And all things close
All I wish
Never change these distances
And shadows blend one last time 
Your picture speaks on this time Shes the one you see
What more can I say
Got the voice of an angel
Perfect in every way
From two till six
we talked we kissed
The night was perfect bliss
And I never felt like this
Holding hands with her through the night
I was scared everythings all right
I know I'm young
She's smart I'm dumb
We leaned in for a kiss
And I never felt like this
This is for the girl who defines beauty
With her long blonde hair
I can't see why everytime I see her
I go weak in the knees
Her name is Lindy and she want me
As I think in my room of the feelings I have spawned
I remind myself in two months you were gone
My time with you my dreams came true
and with you I can't miss
And I never felt like this
This is for the girl who defines beauty
With her long blonde hair
I can't see why everytime that I see her
I go weak in the knees
Her name is Lindy and she wants me
I wrote this song to get you out of my mind
But since I did I think about you all the time
This is for the girl who defines beauty
With her long blonde hair
I cant see why everytime I see her
I go weak in the knees
Her name is Lindy and she wants me
She wants me And I want herPeople say everyday
That she's taking you away and I wish you'd leave her
Everytime I see her
I ask you why And did she lie
About those times with all those other guys
I can see it a mile away
Yeah you're with her everyday
The nights that you just missed
The things that you promised
They never stay 
She's never seen the sun
She wears shorts and I run Awayyyyy

He's dating Casper and he's afraid to ask her for his manhood back
Please give me my friend back
He's dating Casper
His heart races faster
Just for her
Why can't we be like we were
First you skip but now you slip
Sure is sad seeing a guy thats whipped
Just a puppet to sink below she's using you all for show
Back in the day we'd come and play
But now you're asking if you may
Can't you see that she's not the one
She can't even see the sun
The nights that you just missed
The things that you promised
They never stay 
She's never seen the sun
She wears shorts and I run Awayyyyy

I'll ask her will she rip my heart right out
If she hurt me once again 
I'll tell her that's not what I'm all about
I'll stop hurting all my friends we're okay

He's going away
Away
Why can't we be like we wereYour subtleties
They strangle me
I can't explain myself at all
And all that wants
And all that needs
All I don't want to need at all

The walls start breathing
My mind's unweaving
Maybe it's best you leave me alone
A weight is lifted
On this evening
I give the final blow
When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight
It ends tonight
A falling star
Least I fall alone
I can't explain what you can't explain
Your finding things that you didn't know
I look at you with such disdain


When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight
It ends tonight
Just a little insight will make this right
It's too late to fight
It ends tonight
It ends tonight
Now I'm on my own side
It's better than being on your side
It's my fault when you're blind
It's better that I see it through your eyes
All these thoughts locked inside
Now you're the first to know
Coach says I'm real good
Best kid in the neighborhood
Looks like I got a future ahead of me
Startin' quarterback number 13
Mom and dad are so proud of me
I'm down with the cool kids oh yeah

You know I'm cool
The chicks dig me
And its okay
I get replaced but it's alright
'Cause they all know
I'm on the football team
Na na na na na 
I'm on the football team
Na na na na na 
I'm on the football team
Now im gettin chicks left and right
They're lining up for Saturday night
Just to go down on me oh yeah
And when I walk down the hall
All of the nerds and geeks fall
Down on their knees and worship me

Hey dad Guess what
Whats that son
I'm on the football team
Well jiminy in the buckhole
Na na na na na Na na na na na Na na na na na
I'm on the football team Back me down from backing up
Hold your breath now it's stacking up
Etched with marks of my disdain
And you're the problem and you can't feel
Try this on straight jacket feeling
so maybe I won't be alone
Take back now my life you're stealing
Yesterday was hell
But today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you'd be
That face is tearing holes in me again
Trust you is just one defense
off a list of others you don't make sense
Beg me time and time again
to take you back now but you can't win
Take back now my life you're stealing
Yesterday was hell
But today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you'd be
That face is tearing holes in me again
but today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all the things you put me through
I'm holding on by letting go of you
And when that memory slips away
There will be a better view from here
And only lonesome you remains
and just the thought of you I fear
it falls away
Yesterday was hell
Today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you'd be
That face is tearing holes in me again
but today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all the things you put me through
I'm holding on by letting go of youYou couldn't break me in the end 
And such a freedom I enjoy
When you're deaf to the sounds you trust
If that was all you've got my friend 
Then set yourself to disappoint
Yeah
Feels like I'm strapped down on this table so tight
You've got me stuck to a razor's edge
And I'm trapped in a deadbolt glove
You stand to cut me you're unable oh no
And such a streak starts steading heads
And I live for the things I love
Sad but maybe it's true
Push you back's what I'll do
And it's just enough
To keep you back one second longer
Take a little more than what I've got
It's all I have to please you
Break a little piece of what you want
Bite back the hand that feeds you
Remember when things seem so stable you know that
I compromise just to appease
Yeah you take but you take too much
If what you need's not seeming able yeah right
Then maybe it works when I leave
Yeah you fake what you say you love
Sad but maybe it's true
Push you back's what I'll do
And it's just enough
To keep you back one second longer
Take a little more than what I've got
It's all I have to please you
Break a little piece of what you want
Bite back the hand that feeds you
Take a little more than what I've got
It's all I have to please you
Break a little piece of what you want
Bite back the hand that feeds you
Move faster
I can't move enough
How much longer
Is this long enough
We can't be
And it won't even catch your attention
And it pains me so to mention
Sad but maybe it's true
Push you back's what I'll do
And it's just enough
To keep you back one second longer
Take a little more than what I've got
It's all I have to please you
Break a little piece of what you want
Bite back the hand that feeds you
Take a little more than what I've got
It's all I have to please you
Break a little piece of what you want
Bite back the hand that feeds you
Take what I've got
It's all I have to please you
Break what you want
Bite back the hand that feeds you
Take what I've got
It's all I have to please you
Break what you want
Bite back the hand that feeds youI'm outta luck outta love
Gotta photograph picture of
Passion killer you're too much
You're the only one I wanna touch
I see your face every time I dream
On every page every magazine
So wild so free so far from me
You're all I want my fantasy
Oh look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh Oh look what you've done
Photograph  I don't want your
Photograph  I don't need your
Photograph  All I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough
I'd be your lover if you were there
Put your hurt on me if you dare
Such a woman you got style
You make every man feel like a child
You got some kinda hold on me
You're all wrapped up in mystery
So wild so free so far from me
You're all I want my fantasy
Oh Look what you've done to this rock'n'roll clown
Oh Oh Look what you've done

You've gone straight to my headThe future has arrived

Hey Dad what the hell is wrong with me
I almost had the single life for free
But now she comes around
and shoves her face into my mind
I thought that dating was a drag
All I ever knew was my hand
But she's that good to me
And I think she's just that kind 
So kind
My friends tell me to stay away
I know just what to say
That sounds good to me 
I'll pick you up at eight tonight
Who cares about being tied down
I'll get the concept I'll get around
I'm sick of having no one
I'm sick of being so lonely
So lonely
nah nanah nanah nanah nah
nanah nanah nanah nah
nanah nanah nanah nah
She's so perfect for me
nah nanah nanah nanah nah
nanah nanah nanah nah
nanah nanah nanah nah
Sick of being so lonely
She likes to call me twice a day
She calls up just to say
That I'm on her mind
And she thinks about me all the day
Hey mom what the hell is wrong with me
I almost had the single life for free
But now she comes around
and shoves her face into my mind
My mind
nah nanah nanah nanah nah
nanah nanah nanah nah
nanah nanah nanah nah
She's so perfect for me
nah nanah nanah nanah nah
nanah nanah nanah nah
nanah nanah nanah nah
Sick of being so lonely

I'm her boyfriend
And she's my girlfriend
I'm her boyfriend
And she's my girlfriend now
I'm her boyfriend
And she's my girlfriend
I'm her boyfriend
And she's my girlfriendPlease just don't play with me My paper heart will bleed
This wait for destiny won't do
Be with me please I beseech you
Simple things that make you run away
Catch you if I can
Tears fall down your face
The taste is something new
Something that I know
Moving on is easiest when I am around you
So bottle up old love
And throw it out to sea
Watch it away as you cry
Now a year has past
The seasons go
Please just don't play with me
My paper heart will bleed
This wait for destiny won't do
Be with me please I beseech you
Simple things that make you run away
Catch you if I can
Waiting day to day it goes through
My lips are sealed for her
My tongue is
Tied to a dream of being with you
To settle for less is not what I prefer
Summer time the nights they are so long
The leaves fall down and so do I into
the arms of a friend
Winter nights
My bedside is cold for I am gone
And spring blossoms you to meYou were so young and I guess I'm old
Open your eyes I'll keep mine closed
I prefer standing and you take your seat
I'll be wide awake you'll be asleep
And you'll fall down a hole
That's the one place we both know
You take me with you if you could but I wouldn't go
I guess such sometimes we both lose our minds
To find a better road
I can be pensive you can be so sure
You'll be the poison you'll be the cure
I'm alone on the journey I'm alive none the less
And when you do your very worst it feels the best
And you'll fall down a hole
That's the one place we both know
You take me with you if you could but I wouldn't go
I guess such sometimes we both lose our minds
And find a better road
And you'll fall down a hole
That's the one place in this world that we both know
You take me with you if you could
If you could I'd lose everything
Can't you see the faces melting
As the sun rains from their eyes
Go on and keep your head
With the hearts that you hang behind
Look at yourself look in the mirror
Don't you see a lie that you tell yourself
Again a thousand times
And the truth that makes us laugh
Will make you cry
You wanna die No
So you fall down a hole
That's the one place where we both know
You take me with you if you could but I wouldn't go
Because sometimes we both lose our minds
To find a better roadIn the night in the beat city light
We steal ourselves away and hold on tight
You were there yeah we were all there
Too young too smart too much for this one town
We'd get so high we got lost coming down
When we were kids in the street kids in the street
When we were kids in the street just kids in the street
Remember when we
We used to laugh we used to cry
Live and die by the forty five
Take me back I'll go there
Who could stop us and who would care
Always keep to the kids in the street
We were dreams we were American graffiti scenes
But no war no peace no hopes no dreams just us
And the songs with the words we'd sing wrong
And we'd drive until that jealous sun fell down
Just to wash ourselves in the moonlight summer sounds
When we were kids in the street kids in the street
When we were kids in the street just kids in the street
Remember when we
We used to laugh we used to cry
Live and die by the forty five
Take me back I'll go there
Who could stop us and who would care
Always keep to the kids in the street
 and we never felt so alive 
 and we'd dance all night under the sky 
 and we'd live  we'd breathe  we'd die 
 when the world stood still for you and I
Just 
Candles burn 'cause the world will always turn
I'll burn both ends until my fire's out
Lost in the darkness I can still scream out 
We used to laugh we used to cry
Say goodbye to I 35
Take me back down a dirty road
Where it went we didn't care to know
A glory night is a story saved
Mark the chapter but turn the page
Always keep to kids in the street
When we were kids in the street
Just kids in the street

I'll never forget when we started out
The beat of the drum
A face in the crowd
It's better this way it's better this way
How far we've come now not a soul can change
Remember the road running under our feet
We'd shoot for the stars but we'd aim at the trees
It's better this way it's better this way
Gambling with life it was our turn to play
It's time only when you look forward can you see behind
We bought the ticket so we'll take the ride
Every trial and every test
We'd drive to the east and we'd fly to the west
Just running away just running away
We can't be different cause they're all the same
Every night that we'd ever start and every beat of every heart
Is running away just running away
Catching our breath at the end we could say
It's time only when you look forward could you see behind
Every taste we could get was just sweet sublime
Holding onto the moment we let go of life
We bought the ticket so we'll take the ride
Day after day in the light
We're glowing in the dark
Standing was the sketch
Where falling wasn't hard
We lost ourselves to find our somewhere down the line this time
Day after day in the light
We're glowing in the dark
Standing was the sketch
Where falling wasn't hard
We lost ourselves to find our somewhere down the line this time
For some it's a god for me it's a fact
We'd make a mistake and try to take 'em all back
It's better this way it's better this way
Out of the grind and then into the grave
It's time it's time only when you look forward could you see behind
Every taste we could get was just sweet sublime
Holding onto the moment we let go of life
We bought the ticket so we'll take the ride
We bought the ticket so we'll take the rideI always wonder where you are
I'm right beside you you're so far away
Moments you're not facing me
Moments you're not chasing me
I don't believe in good goodbyes
Cause even when the roses die
There's still some thorns left in your side
It's like a funeral for the bride
And I know candy girls yeah they just wrapped your tears
I've always been such a sucker for sweets
I need affection
All I want right now is affection
I don't mean to point your direction
Girl it's not what you do
What you don't do makes me talk to you about affection
I need affection
Somewhere along is when I died
On the banks of some canal
Yeah the river bed of tears I tried to ride
Even fools will believe in lies
And if every word you said were true
You'd be my god and I'd just pray to you for affection
All I want right now is affection
I don't mean to make a confession
Girl it's not what you do
What you don't do makes a man come unglued
Affection I need affection
Why won't you dance with me

There's no more romance with me

You don't think I see you
But I see right through you baby
Affection
All I want someone's affection
All I need to was affection
What ya do 
What ya do 
Where'd ya go
Affection
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
And don't think I see you
I see right through you
You don't think I see you
But I doSay the words I cannot say
Say them on another day
Fragile words like these will cut your tongue
Was I good enough
Was I bad enough
When I wanted more yeah you had enough
But nobody's gonna try for you
Nobody's gonna do like I for you
And every slowlit cigarette that nervous hands can barely get the courage
I could always feel your eyes
And those dresses you made look like gowns
You're a sinner but the devil even turned you down
'Cause nobody's gonna try for you
Nobody's gonna do like I for you
And nobody's gonna try for you
And nobody's gonna lie for you
And nobody's gonna do like I for you
Hold me like you never could
I'll hold you like I said I would
Air or light won't breathe nor shine between
With your feather lips yeah you fly away
Well I hope they come back down someday
'Cause nobody's gonna try for you
Nobody's gonna do like I for you
Somebody's getting by for you
I don't bend I just break in two
Somebody like me I'd die for youI've been known a thousand ways
Choked a hundred hearts in half as many days
Oh no I think so
And I get so lost inside this city
You ugly girls all look so pretty it's true
What am I supposed to do
I still got you away
Look out your window
What do you see
You don't see me
You're a pretty little flower
I'm a busy little bee
Honey that's all you need to see
I can take you for an hour
But then I'm gonna leave
Honey I know you'll wait for me
You're all alone but you understand
That we're too young to start making plans of green
Monogamy's not a part of me
And I know my line and is just a sin
When I swear to you I'm gonna do it again
I'm not making any friends
I just wanted you to wait
There out your window
What do you see
You don't see me
Cause you're a pretty little flower
But I'm a busy little bee
Honey that's all you need to see
I can take you for an hour
Baby then I'm gonna leave
Honey I know you'll wait for me
Pulled out your picture the other day

You didn't have that much to say

'Cause I know that you said
I'm better of on my own and I'm better off dead
I just want you there to wait
Look out your window
What do you see
You don't see me
Come on come on come on
Dirty little flower
I'm a busy little bee
Honey that's all you need to see
I can take you for an hour
Maybe two or maybe three
Honey I know you'll wait for me
Honey that's all it has to beHow long has it been since I ripped you
These paper cut hands need to stop
And lonely's a plague but it skipped you
I suffer till you cut me up
Then I bleed into your mind
I need to make you blind
I bleed into your mind
I need you one last time
Well you put yourself together
Pieces of you slipped away
And some are forever whenever
Put me on my knees at your feet and
Then I bleed into your mind
I need to make you blind
I bleed into your mind
I need you one last time
You'll never forgive me I can not forgive you
Yeah I feel you full of little lies
You're still hungry for the truth
And I know we've got our problems
Let's just try to solve them
In your mind I stay with you
I know in time you'll feel it to
Then I bleed into your mind
I need to make you blind
I bleed into your mind
I need you one last
Then I bleed into your mind
With a love that will make you blind
I bleed into your mind
I need you one lastShot by bedroom eyes
And that screaming silence frozen fire hypnotize
And I can't disguise the words that I steal from your lips
A ransom for your body bind your fingertips
Then just so be it
And I walk out the door
I walk right out the door
And next to you
And I never asked for more
I get my fix if I get close to you
With just a dose of you
We're both right
We feast on poisoned apples and I'm just in time
But I'm petrified
Oh I take my time and you're the clock
And that second hand you place on me
My heart could stop
And it's tick tock tick tock
And I walk out the door
I walk right out the door
And next to you
Cause I needed to
And I never asked for more
I get my fix if I get close to you
With just a dose of you
Every single day I remember you would take away
Even if it's wrong
And I walk out the door
And I walk out the door
I walk right out the door
And next to you
Cause I needed to
I never asked for more
I get my fix if I get close to you
With just a dose of you
Every single day I remember you would take away
Even if it's wrong
And I walk out the door
I walk out the door
And I walk out the door
And I walk out the doorOne two three four
Da da da da da da da da da

What makes you so damn sure
That you're perfect huh
I can't explain you
Just like a nightmare
I can't remember
What makes you so damn sure
That you're worth it huh
You're just a bad trip
I can't come back from since last December
Walk into the room and you steal everyone
I see you walk into the room
And you kill everyone cause I know
My someday's gone now
Bye bye
My someday's gone now
Bye bye just let it go
How did you figure that I let you cut me down
Right at the knees
I fall like a dead man out of the airplane
How do you figure that I let you drag me around huh
You got my number draw me a story tell me a picture
Walk into the room and you've had everyone
And then you walked into the room it's so sad everybody already knows
My someday's gone now
Bye bye
My somedays gone now
Bye bye just let it go
'Cause even when I live a piece of me will die
Win some lose some she won't bat an eye
Maybe when I sleep
I see you in my dreams
Forget about it one day
Damn I see
You walk into the room and you fucked everyone
And then you walked into the room well so what everybody already knows
My someday's gone now
Bye bye
My someday's gone now
Bye bye
My someday's gone now bye bye
Let go
Let it go
Let it go
Let her go
Let her goIf only for tonight
Yeah I could dig myself a grave
But even 6 feet down I know
I'll be found feeling this way
If only I could find
Yeah just a reason to believe
That there's nothing that's up your sleeve
Even though you're wearing that tank top
Love me or leave me but just not behind
We don't need money the way we spend time
'Cause if it's real tonight you and I could really do something
You go fast I'll go slow
Meet you in the middle just to let you know
It's gonna be alright 
If it's me and you tonight 
You go fast I go slow
Light my fuse and your body explodes
It's going to be alright 
Are you ready now I'm ready now
If only I were bright 
Then I could let go of my brain
Put a tourniquet on and your sweet injection into my vein
And Oh that's the stuff 
And I say that you're the drug
Twelve steps wouldn't be enough to kick your just that rough
Make me a crazy I just can't define
There's not a closet for you in my mind
Oh but you puzzle me tonight
Let's play with your bits and pieces
You go fast I'll go slow
Meet you in the middle just to let you know
It's gonna be alright 
If it's me and you tonight 
You go fast I go slow
Light my fuse and your body explodes
It's going to be alright 
Are you ready now I'm ready now
Baby
Oh I wanna take my time 
If you stay with me once again once again
It's a heart attack heart attack
'Cause I want you so bad 
Well I hope for ever 
You go fast I'll go slow
You go fast I'll go slow
Meet you in the middle just to let you know
It's gonna be alright 
If it's me and you tonight 
You go fast I go slow
Light my fuse and your body explodes
It's going to be alright 
Are you ready now I'm ready now
Are you ready now
Are you ready now
Are you ready now
Are you ready now
Doctor doctor
Could you please just give me somethin' for the state I'm in
I'm having trouble and society believe I got it wrong again
I'm one month sober I don't think I'm getting over my predicament
But if I jumped out of the window what would she say
It's not on me it's all on you
We can't deny the things we do
I can't believe her pretty feet walked over me
All over me
Help me help me doctor
Seems to be an awful lot for me to understand
I know I'm not a specimen
The troubles and the mess I'm in
I should be dead
He said let's all start think
Then you've had all your fun
It's time to be a man
So you better quit your bitchin'
Think about what the people would say
It's not on me it's all on you
I can't prescribe what you want me to
You need some sleep you better leave
He walked over me
All over me
Wait until tomorrow and it's gone
So long
Wait until tomorrow so long
And it's gone
Wait until tomorrow
You beg and steal and borrow till it's gone

I need someone to love

Somebody help me cause I could hear the voices in the tube
To get me through anything I do and anything will do good by me
A little pill a little thrill should I take it I think I will
And anything will do good so as long as it's always too good
Either way I don't give a damn what you people all say
All now boy
It's not on me it's all on you
I can't deny the things I do
I can't believe her pretty feet walked over me
All over me
It's not on me it's all on you
There comes a time to speak the truth
So you can see me when I leave
Walk over you
All over you yeahI still remember that empty look left on your face
You took the pictures but you left the frames
All we had written well it's been erased
Something that I had to do
I cut you deep you're bleeding through
You're every single shade of blue
I'm staring right in front of you
I can hear your heartbeat slowing down
I can hear your heartbeat turn me around
You can take my life
All you need make me right
I can't sleep with your heartbeat slowing down
Here you left scattered
Like wishes I led to your room
Bury my face in your pillow
Just to smell your perfume
Outside I'm hungry
But inside I'm just consumed
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe
Losing you is choking me
I can hear your heartbeat slowing down
I can hear your heartbeat turn me around
You can take my life
All you need make me right
I can't sleep with your heartbeat slowing down
I fucking hate this town
I wanna burn it down
I never felt so cold
And when I burn this town
I hope I burn it down
And leave me on my own
I fucking hate this town
I wanna burn it down
I never felt so cold
I can hear your heartbeat slowing down
I can hear your heartbeat slowing down
I can hear your heartbeat turn me around
You can take my life
All you need make me right
How can you sleep with your heartbeat slowing down
I can hear your heartbeat slowing downShe's gone away but still they stay together
People call me crazy crazy
My thoughts progress think about forever
My mind tells me maybe maybe
I wish I could drive away to the sunset
Back to the day that we first met
Only believe the things I wrote
I'll put it in a note yeah
I'll cross my T's and not my I's
Better say hello don't you dare say goodbye
I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name
PS I love you forever and today
Two weeks go by so like its been the weather
The rain falls down she's crying crying
My thoughts progress she thinks about forever
Their hearts are bond lying lying
I wish I could drive away to the sunset
Back to the day that we first met
Only believe the things I wrote
I'll put it in a note yeah
I'll cross my T's and not my I's
Better say hello I'm gonna wave goodbye
I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name
PS I love you forever and today
All the heartbreak all the pain
All the words you said in vain
And I'll never be the same
I wish I could drive away to the sunset
Back to the day that we first met
Only believe the things I wrote
I'll put it in a note yeah
I'll cross my T's and dot my I's
Better say hello I'm gonna wave goodbye
I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name
PS I love you forever and today
Forever and today forever and today
PS I love you forever and todayShe screams when I'm away She's been gone before
I worry all the time why worry anymore
Now I go away
Now I know today
I picked out your star
Turned night to day
A simple whisper from your voice
And I fade away
You wish for love
You pushed me away
Your love for me was everything I need
The air I breathe
She now she's all alone
Her eyes they drown in tears
Their love was meant to last
But she is blind with fear
Now I go away
Now I know today
Leave me be
Now I'm free
Love reflecting everything
You want space
I need you to help me see this throughIs there anybody out there
That wakes up with a bitter taste
It's a king that we put up there
And he's a short way to fall from grace
It's slowly filling upward
You can stand but you have no ground
I hear it from the lost words
They say its time that you lost your crown
Don't be so greedy
A dollar's a penny to you
When hearts are beating
Say what you want 'em to do
Wasting away I see you
When the top of the world falls on you
Finding a day don't want to be you
When the top of the world falls on you
Is there anybody out there
That can see what a man can change
It's better that you don't care
Because he knows that he's in his state
I feel the paranoia
When there's a time put you in your place
In the eyes of those who watch ya
Well they can wait 'til they hit your face
Don't be so greedy
A dollar's a penny to you
When hearts are beating
Say what you want 'em to do
Wasting away I see you
When the top of the world falls on you
Finding a day don't want to be you
When the top of the world falls on you
Paint yourself a picture
When you waste another picture
And you win and you win and you win
Paint yourself a picture
And then you break another picture
And you win and you win and you win
And you win Yeah you win and you win
Don't be so greedy
A dollar's a penny to you
When hearts are beating
Say what you want 'em to do
Wasting away I see you
When the top of the world falls on you
Finding a day don't want to be you
When the top of the world falls on you
Don't be so greedy
A dollar's a penny to you
When hearts are beating
Say what you want 'em to do
Wasting away I see you
When the top of the world falls on you
Finding a day don't want to be you
When the top of the world falls on youYou speak to me and
I know this will be temporary
You ask to leave
But I can tell you that I've had enough
I can't take it
This welcome is gone and
I've waited long enough to make it
And if you're so strong
You might as well just do it alone
And I'll watch you go
Step up to me
I know that you've got something buried
I'll set you free
You set conditions but I've had enough
I can't take it
This welcome is gone and
I've waited long enough to make it
And if you're so strong
You might as well just do it alone
And I'll watch you go
Won't you come back home won't you come home
You step in line you got a lot to prove
It comes and goes
Yeah it comes and goes
A step in time yeah it's a lot to move
I know this will be temporary
I know this will be temporary
I know this will be but I've had enough
I can't take it
This welcome is gone and
I've waited long enough to make it
And if you're so strong
You might as well just do it alone
And I'll watch you go
I can't take it
This welcome is gone and
I've waited long enough to make it
And if you're so strong
You might as well just do it alone
And I'll watch you goThis may be the last thing that I write for long
Can you hear me smiling when I sing this song for you and only you
As I leave will you be someone to say goodbye
As I leave will you be someone to wipe your eye
My foot is out the door and you can't stop me now
You wanted the best it wasn't me will you give it back
Now I'll take the lead when there's no more room to make it grow
I'll see you again you'll pretend you're naive is this what you want
Is this what you need how you end up let me know
As I go remember all the simple things you know
My mind is just a crutch and I still hope that you will miss me when
I'm gone
This is the last song
The hearts start breaking as the year is gone
The dream's beginning and the time rolls on
It seems so surreal now I sing it
Somehow I knew that I would be this way
Somehow I knew that I would slowly fade
Now I'm gone just try and stop me now
And will you need me now you'll find a way somehow
You want it too I want it tooShe's gone away but still they stay together
People call me crazy crazy
My thoughts progress I think about forever
My mind tells me maybe maybe
I wish I could drive away to the sunset
Back to the day that we first met
Only believe the things I wrote
I'll put it in a note yeah
Cross my t's and dot my I's
Better say hello don't you dare say goodbye
I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name
PS I love you forever and today
Two weeks go by seems like it's been the weather
The rain falls down she's crying crying
My thoughts progress she thinks about forever
Their hearts are bound lying lying
I wish I could drive away to the sunset
Back to the day that we first met
Only believe the things I wrote
I'll put it in a note yeah
Cross my t's and dot my I's
Better say hello I'm gonna wave goodbye

PS I love you forever and today
Forever and today 
PS I love you forever and todayWent to bed with a smile
Bragged to my firends for a little while
And I wished for another date
to *sit with you dazin'* I was in this state
of tossing and turning not knowing what to do
Just sitting and waiting for a call from you
I know that its real and its no surprise
To see that its true I look into your eyes
Yes she changed me And now Im not the same
And I know just how I have a world when she says my name
Now I see you every day
I go out of my way just to see your face
and school with you isnt the same
Sleepless nights and our jokes are lame
I am hoping and dreaming of another night like this
Restless and yearning for your sweet kiss
I know that its real Its no surprise
To see that its true i look into your eyes
Oh Yes she changed me now im not the same
I know now just how I have a world when she says me name
She changed me and now im not the same
And I know now just how I *have a world* when she says my name
Tossing and turning not knowing what to do
Just sitting and waiting for a call from you
I know that its real and its no surprise
To see that its true I look into your eyes
Yes she changed me And now Im not the same
And I know just how I have a world when she says my name
Tossing and turning not knowing what to do
Just sitting and waiting for a call from you
I know that its real and its no surprise
To see that its true I look into your eyes
Oh Yes she changed me And now Im not the same
And I know just how I have a world when she says my nameOne question what can't be done
You tear me down with the same thing
There's nothing the end it's begun
What can you do when it all drains
Down there you go always
See if I care fading
Down don't you know where I'll be
'Cause I'm here on my own
Waiting when I'm waiting
Don't you know I've been here before
And I don't care where I'm going
So I'll stay
When you walk don't leave a note
Just put your hands on the back door
When you talk it's just a joke
Just know I can't take it anymore
Down there you go always
See if I care fading
Down don't you know where I'll be
'Cause I'm here on my own
Waiting when I'm waiting
Don't you know I've been here before
And I don't care where I'm going
So I'll be waiting when I'm waiting
Don't you know I'll tell you once more
That as long as you're gone
Then I'll stay
Outside there's no place I can hide
And you're dead of time is anything alright
When the wind tries the storm won't subside
You'll be outside and I'm in here and I'll call
Waiting when I'm waiting
Don't you know I've been here before
And I don't care where I'm going
So I'll be waiting when I'm waiting
Don't you know I'll tell you once more
That as long as you're gone
Then I'll stay then I'll stay
I missed it
And you'll go
Then I'll stay stayYou're sweet just like the sun
But what happens when the sun doesn't stay
The night reminds me when you went away
Now my mind was pacing heart is racing contemplating things that I lack
Even though you left me by myself do I want you back
Will you stay or will you walk
Will you let go
Leave me all alone
I'm giving you one more chance
To make things last
Ring around the roses then she'll stay
Leave me once
Leave me twice
Kiss goodbye that will suffice
When you go away
Don't look back
Leave me once and I'll be fine
Leave me twice I'll make you mine
Just one more chance to make it once again
As the days go by I am asking why did you leave
You left me alone and then you walked out on me
Thinking of days thinking of ways thhinking of things that I should say
I want to be with you and that's the only wayDon't solve the problem
When danger is bitter
Fall where we stuck them
In cages of tither
And all the bridges you've burned
Leave you trapped off at all sides
And now the tables do turn
And it's all gone what's left for you
And when the sky is falling
Don't look outside the window
Step back and hear I'm calling
Give up don't take the fast road
It's just your debt that binds you
Just drop the stocks behind you now
Change your mind
You let go too soon
Sit down you're sinking
There's no one to watch you
Skip town you're thinking
There's no one to stop you
And all the bridges you've burned
Leave you trapped off at all sides
And now the tables do turn
And it's all gone what's left for you
Don't run away
Stop feeling fine
It's better than your worst your worst day
No words to say I'll give you mine
And pocket all the hurt and just stay
Don't run away
It's better than your worst your worst day
And when the sky is falling
Don't look outside the window
Step back and hear I'm calling
Give up don't take the fast road
Don't run away
Change your mind
You let go too soonGo ahead as you waste your days with thinking
When you fall everyone stands
Another day and you've had your fill of sinking
With the life held in your
Hands are shaking cold
These hands are meant to hold
Speak to me
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along move along just to make it through
Move along
Move along
So a day when you've lost yourself completely
Could be a night when your life ends
Such a heart that will lead you to deceiving
All the pain held in your
Hands are shaking cold
Your hands are mine to hold
Speak to me
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along move along just to make it through
Move along

When everything is wrong we move along

When everything is wrong we move along
Along along along along
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along move along just to make it through
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along move along just to make it through
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along move along like I know you do 
And even when your hope is gone
Move along move along just to make it through


Right back what is wrong
We move along

Right back what is wrong
We move along

Right back what is wrong
We move along

Right back what is wrong
We move alongLet me know that I've done wrong
When I've known this all along
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you
Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one that needs to know
I'll keep you my dirty little secret

Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret

My dirty little secret
Who has to know
When we live such fragile lives
It's the best way we survive
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you
Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one that needs to know
I'll keep you my dirty little secret

Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret

My dirty little secret
Who has to know
The way she feels inside 
Those thoughts I can't deny 
These sleeping thoughts won't lie 
And all I've tried to hide
It's eating me apart
Trace this life out
I'll keep you my dirty little secret

Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret

I'll keep you my dirty little secret

Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret

My dirty little secret
Dirty little secret
Dirty little secret
Who has to know
Who has to knowYou don't have to move you don't have to speak
Lips follow biting
You're staring me down a glance makes me weak
Eyes follow striking
Now I'm twisting up when I'm twisted with you
Brush so lightly
And time trickles down and I'm breathing for two
Squeeze so tightly
I'll be fine you'll be fine
This moment seems so long
Don't waste new precious time
We'll dance inside the song
What makes the one to shake you down
Each touch belongs to each new sound
Say now you want to shake me too
Move down to me slip into you
She sinks in my mind as she sheds through her skin
Touch like taste like fire
Hands to know what I no longer defend
Hands to fuel desire
I'll be fine you'll be fine
This moment seems so long
Don't waste new precious time
We'll dance inside the song
What makes the one to shake you down
Each touch belongs to each new sound
Say now you want to shake me too
Move down to me slip into you
Ooo ah
Ooo ah
Ooo ah
Ooo ah 
And I'll be fine you'll be fine
Is this fine I'm not fine
Give me pieces give me things to stay awake 
What makes the one to shake you down
Each touch belongs to each new sound
Say now you want to shake me too
Move down to me slip into you
What makes the one to shake you down
Each touch belongs to each new sound
Say now you want to shake me too
Move down to me slip into youHim and her
Life is turned
The day I knew you would leave
I can barely breath
Can you hear me scream
Ooo thrown in all directions
You epitome of perfection
She's lost her will
Time is standing still
He walks her home
Now he walks alone
The days they turn into years
The eyes they drown in tears
Can you hear me scream
The way we are the way they were

The time with you the time is stirred

The hearts they turn they turn away

Love lost was found night turns to day
Time is standing stillTime does tell
That even if they say so
She'd be the one that would know
That I did do what I've done
And I I wouldn't call it cheating
I'd just say I was leading her on
Why walk while I run away
You you ask me what went wrong
Me I'll write you this last song
Please just tell me one way we can win
One more thing before I go
Two the one who loves me so
Three don't make me count to three again
Happy endings
Just what did you do If you're a dream then come true
Stop pretending
That what you mean isn't what you say
Hopeful dreaming
Of times before the pain wishing it was still the same
Loving leaving
Round and round and round we go again
Walks alone have often lead to thinking
My love for you is sinking to what seems an all time low
Or high the limits' never ending
And don't you know I'm sending
There's no venture I won't go
For youBring back the memories
This one's giving up on you
I don't miss giving up on you
And there's no more time
Forgive me one more time
'Cause I don't want you
Away
Just bury me I am
Away
Whispered warning
Away
Just bury me I am
Away
And not a day has passed
That I'm regretting
The window's closed
And she's not letting me in
One place one place slipped away and
Missed call missed calls
I can't stay too late
She's gone
I will miss her voice her eyes
And love's first kiss
I can't remind you all the time
Bring it back bring it back
To where we were before
I can't remind you all the time
No no
Bring it back bring it back
One place one place slipped away
Missed call missed calls
I can't stay too late
She's gone
I will miss her voice her eyes
And love's first kiss
The day is gone
The sky is blue
I know you're all alone
And the sky is blue
Come back to me
The sky is blue
The sky is blueAll the windows
Swear to miss you
And the doors are cell block tight
Sweet sedation
Sweep the issues
And the clocks about to strike
Did it call you down
Are you back just yet
Waiting now please come set me free
And the only sound is a minute left
This could be this could be the last time
It's a chance to fix mistakes
One more for the last time
Does it blow our dreams away
Don't waste this chance with your smile
Ten seconds left on this dial
This could be the last time
Along the staircase
I dream to hear you
In a whisper quiet room
Space the thinking
Space to scream to
But the echoes sound like you
Not the stars at night
In a pitch black sky
I don't know just wants to see you
But the time is right and it only flies
This could be this could be the last time
It's a chance to fix mistakes
One more for the last time
Does it blow our dreams away
Don't waste this chance with your smile
Ten seconds left on this dial
This could be the last time
It's only us
It's only now
A simple wish
It's only tonight
This could be the last time
Now I've made our last mistake
One more for the last time 
Does it blow our dreams away 
Don't waste this chance with your smile 
Ten seconds left on this dial 
This could be the last time 
It's only us
It's only now
It's only tonightI should warn you
Things you're feeling aren't normal now
Think you need me
It's not easy let you go some how
Now we're too far gone
Hope is such a waste
Every breath you take you give
Me the burdens bitter taste
You promise that you'd stay
You say you want to go
Your lips provide a shelter for the
Things that I don't know
Please speak slowly
My heart is learning
Teach me heartache
Stop this burning nowI know you
So better than the city in the rear view
I drive to
Eliminate the ball that I'm chained to
Take me break me
Every mile further there's a part of me that slips away
One day you'll see
Even if you got down on your knees you couldn't make me stay
Drive all night
Never gonna get me
Night by night
To get away from it all
Fight fight fight
All you want to do is hurt me
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
Pulse stays strong
I'm pushing on the pedal til I break dawn
So I'm gone go find another shoulder you can cry on
Take me break me
Every mile further there's a part of me that slips away
One day you'll see
Even if you got down on your knees you couldn't make me stay
Drive all night
Never gonna get me
Night by night
To get away from it all
Fight fight fight
All you want to do is hurt me
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm going to have to drive all night
All of the things that you knew that I'd try
All of the things that I held inside
All I gotta do is drive
Drive all night
Never gonna get me
Night by night
To get away from it all
Fight fight fight
All you want to do is hurt me
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all nightI worry I wonder all the time why worry
It's killing me forget about it
I whisper remember what she did
Don't miss her
Set me free she won't allow it
Angry and gone and the list goes on and on
Now I'm letting up I should be the one who's letting go
She's lonely she's scared I'm relationship impaired
If it's love I will differ I'm being lost being with her
I can't move on I can't take it
She she says we won't maaake it now
I can't move on I can't take it
She she says we won't maaake it now
Believing the things I did were wrong
I'm leaving
It fades away forget about it
She's binding can't do a thing alone
Rewinding
Times before can't live without it
I don't know
But you did but you did ut yoou did
Please don't go
Now my feelings for you they're now lost
'Cause we're through anymore
I'll write you  I'll call you
NowOne boy one girl two hearts their world
Time goes by secrets rise
One more sad song tears shed she's gone
She'd take it back if she only could
All the perfect words they seem so wrong
She's gone
You wish that you could learn to see
The door is closed and you wish you could be
Alone with you alone with me
What can I do I can not breath
My heart is torn for all to see
Alone with you alone with me
Best friend worst thing she's been cheating
Friend deceives she leaves
Last date she cries whispers goodbye
She walks once more out that door
Please stay don't go away
The hardest thing is letting go of you
Stay don't go away
The hardest thing is letting go of you
What can I do
Alone with you alone with me what can I do
I can not see alone with alone withDays swiftly come and go
I'm dreaming of her
She's seeing other guys
Emotions they stir
The sun is gone
The nights are long
And I am left while the tears fall
Did you think that I would cry
On the phone
Do you know what it feels like
Being alone
I'll find someone new
 swing swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way
To carry on again
Wish cast into the sky
I'm moving on
Sweet beginnings do arise
She knows I was wrong
The notes are old
They bend they fold
And so do I to a new love
Did you think that I would cry
On the phone
Do you know what it feels like
Being alone
I'll find someone new
 swing swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way
To carry on again
Bury me

Carry me

 swing swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way
To carry on again
To carry on again
To carry on againNow we're broken on the floor
She just wants me to share her
It hasn't been this way before
She just wants me to dare her
The phone rings
And she screams
Stab my back
It's better when I bleed for you
Walk on me
It never was enough to do
I can't get past her
Falling faster
True
It hasn't done a lot for you
And every time he held you close
Yeah were you thinking of me
When I needed you the most
Well I hope that you're happy
The phone rings
And she screams
Stab my back
It's better when I bleed for you
Walk on me
It never was enough to do
I can't get past her
Falling faster
True
It's better when I bleed for you
I hope that love he gave you
Was just enough to save you
You nearly broke my heart
Just look at what you're tearing apart
Stab my back
It's better when I bleed for you
Walk on me
It never was enough to do
I can't get past her
Falling faster
True
It hasn't done a lot for you
It's better when I bleed for you
It never was enough to do
It hasn't done a lot forMy best friend is a DJ and he's spinning somewhere Friday

Make your girlfriend be your boyfriend
And we'll pregame at my house
'Cause that's what we're all about
And I'll roll my spliff take a hit
My shit's so lit we ain't ever gonna quit
We don't give a fuck we don't we don't give a fuck
Smoking ciggies in the car with the windows up
We don't give a fuck we don't we don't give a fuck
Like sex on an ex in an ice cream truck
We don't give a fuck we don't we don't give a fuck
We got pills pills alcohol catch us when we free fall
We don't give a fuck we don't we don't give a fuck
Nah a fuck at all
So fuck it all
My daddy hates me momma loves me
Gives me all my daddy's money
What's a day job What's a pay check
Got myself a line of credit
Put my boyfriend on my tab
You can just give me the cash
And I'll roll my spliff take a hit
My shit's so lit we ain't ever gonna quit
We don't give a fuck we don't we don't give a fuck
Smoking ciggies in the car with the windows up
We don't give a fuck we don't we don't give a fuck
Like sex on an ex in an ice cream truck
We don't give a fuck we don't we don't give a fuck
We got pills pills alcohol catch us when we free fall
We don't give a fuck we don't we don't give a fuck
Nah a fuck at all
So fuck it all
We don't care
If you hate us for this song
We're not listening
We we don't care
If you hate us for this song
Cause we're not sorry
We got pills pills alcohol catch us when we free fall
Pills pills alcohol catch us when we free fall
No home student loan won't you take me on my own
Pills pills alcohol
We don't give a fuck we don't we don't give a fuck
You can take that shit and smoke it all up
We don't give a fuck we don't we don't give a fuck
Smoking ciggies in the car with the windows up
We don't give a fuck we don't we don't give a fuck
Like sex on an ex in an ice cream truck
We don't give a fuck we don't we don't give a fuck
We got pills pills alcohol catch us when we free fall
We don't give a fuck we don't give a motherfuck at all
Nah a fuck at all

There's a place
Somewhere that's between dream and awake
That's where we'll find each other
And I know that that sounds stupid
It'll give us both something to find
When we were kids
All runandgun and backtalk kinda kids
We'd get drunk out on the sidewalk and we'd laugh ourselves home
Used to do that kinda shit all the time
And what I fight today
I always keep those yesterdays in my mind

All I want wanted
Was to be want wanted by you

Cause when goodbyes
Get easy we'll alI be alone
But why God why
Can't this one just be even though
That I'm gearing up for this battle
Even if I know that I may never win
When you throw yourself away
Just to throw yourself away again

All I want wanted
Was to be want wanted by you
All I need I needed
Was to be need needed by you

In your heart that's where I'll always be
Now close your eyes and I will never leave
It's funny how I see us hand in hand
I miss you already understand
That I know that you aren't ready
But you don't get to pick the day
That the worst one in your life will land right on
I can hear you beg for more
I can hold you in this song

All I want wanted
Was to be want wanted by you
By you by you and honey
All I need all I needed
Yeah was to be just to be needed by youI woke up on this side
I thought it was a dream
At first we learned to walk
Then learned to scream
You can't understand
When you're fed from a TV screen
You can't see the things that I can see
But I forget that you thank god and pray
Some things just never stay
And we all just slip away
This cant be the real world now
I don't believe it
When I can't see the truth
Welcome to the real world now
When all our carried in now just to poison you
Am I
The only one who thinks it's tragic
This cant be the real world now
No oh uh no oh
I look for some hope in every face that has a vacant stare
The shadows come but no one seems to care
The darkness floods every light that promised change
She passed sound asleep when the blood is stain the blood is pain
Somewhere I know that I'm not all alone
This bated breath I hold
My lungs want to explode
This cant be the real world now
I don't believe it
When I can't see the truth
Welcome to the real world now
When all our carried in now just to poison you
Am I
The only one who thinks it's tragic
This cant be the real world now
No oh uh no oh
Just as soon as we see every floor in every mean will understand
Before the first time
Child to a mans only real words that he can
Its too late to smell the roses
When all emotions set aside
In a whisper say goodbye
This cant be the real world now
I don't believe it
When I can't see the truth
Welcome to the real world now
When all our carried in now just to poison you
Am I
The only one who thinks it's tragic
This cant be the real world now
No oh uh no oh
This cant be the real world
This cant be the real world
This cant be the real world now
No oh uh no ohIf you feel like running today
You know I'd understand
You don't but you long
It's easier to get away
When on the other hand
You know I'm not much better without you
I'm like your victim and all that you need is an alibi
Its one thing about you
I don't wanna make you cry
Damn girl
Dry your eyes
You stole my heart and then you kicked it aside
No girl you can't see
When he's inside you know theres no room for me
If you can take a chance
Find you that better man
A life seize from your quick disease
You're giving all my loving away
Tell me to understand
Cause you know
I'm not much better without you
Ill press your lips and I taste everyone that you've had tonight
Its one thing about you
I don't wanna taste tonight
Damn girl
Dry your eyes
You stole my heart and then you kicked it aside
No girl you can't see
When he's inside you know theres no room for me
And I used to think that I was all you would need
Nah nah nah
There you go again
Nah nah nah
Oh you think that you could just push me around
Nah nah nah
Yeah there you go again
You lift me up and then you throw me back down
Damn girl
Dry your eyes
You stole my heart and then you kicked it aside
No girl you can't see
When he's inside you know theres no room for me
Damn girl
Dry your eyes
You stole me heart and then you kicked it aside
No girl you can't see
When he's inside you know theres no room for me
And I used to think that I was all you would need
If you feel like running today you know I'd understandI don't ever want to believe
I don't ever want to believe yeah
That when we die
We all leave
Your innocence is not forgotten
I hope you know that where you are I wish you well
I hope you sleep in a perfect memory
You know it's hard I tried
I could never say goodbye
I don't ever wanna believe
I don't ever wanna believe yeah
That when we die
We all leave
I don't ever wanna let go
I hope that you see yeah
That there's a part of you that's left inside of me
Yesterday just took me hostage
Yesterday locked me away from any truth
And now tomorrow's here without you
I know it's hard I've tried
I could never say goodbye
I don't ever wanna believe
I don't ever wanna believe yeah
That when we die
We all leave
I don't ever wanna let go
I hope that you see yeah
That there's a part of you that's left inside of me
I try to push you away
But you never push back
You know I'll never forget you
I never thought I'd say that
You made a mess out of me
I don't ever wanna believe
I don't ever wanna believe yeah
That when we die
That we all leave
I don't ever wanna believe
I don't ever wanna believe yeah
That when we die
That we all leave
I don't ever wanna let go
I hope that you see yeah
That theres a part of you thats left inside of me I woke up on this side I thought it was a dream
At first we learned the walk then learned to scream
You don't understand it's a place that you can't believe
And you can't see the things that I can see
But I forget that you think I'm afraid
Somethings just never stay
And we'll all just slip away
This can be the real world now
I don't believe it that I can see that soon
Welcome to the real world now
And I don't want to believe that it's a place for you
And I I hope you think it's tragic
So I know
This can be the real world now
And no no
And no oh
Look out the window at the sky that doesn't care
I look up for the sun but it's not there
The rivers flood and the ground beneath me shakes
Turn your eyes I bet you hope that window breaks you hope it breaks
But still I know that you can make the change
Somethings just never stay
And we all just slip away
This can be the real world now
I don't believe it that I can see that soon
Welcome to the real world now
You try to wind your watch but we're all running out of time
I hope you think it's tragic
So I know
This can be the real world now
And no no
And no oh
This can be the real world now
And no no
And no oh
Just as soon that you see that it's not the way that it should be
You'll understand just for the first time
As fake as it seems that we all share in this disease
So are the damned just for the last time
This can be the real world now
I don't believe it that I can see that soon
Welcome to the real world now
You try to wind your watch but we're all running out of time

So I know
This can be the real world now
And no no
And no oh
This can be the real world now
And no no
And no oh
This can be the real world now
And no no
And no oh
This can be the real world now
And no no
And no ohDo you remember when we didn't care
We were just two kids that took the moment when it was there
Do you remember you at all
Another heart calls
Yeah I remember when we stole the night
We'd lie awake but dreaming 'til the sun would wash the sky
Just as soon as I see you
But didn't I but didn't I tell you
As deep as I need you
You wanna leave it all
What can I do
Say it's true
Or everything that matters breaks in two
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you
Talk to me
I'm throwing myself in front of you
This could be the last mistake
That I would ever wanna do
Yeah all I ever do is give it's time you see my point of view
Just as soon as I see you
But didn't I but didn't I tell you
As deep as I need you
You wanna leave it all
What can I do
Say it's true
Or everything that matters breaks in two
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you
But I know what you want is to figure it out
And God knows I do too
What can I do
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Na na na na na na
I'm sorry
So what
But you don't think I've said enough
I'm sorry
I don't care
You were never there
As soon as I see you
But didn't I but didn't I tell you
As deep as I need you
You wanna leave it all
What can I do
Say it's true
Or everything that matters breaks in two
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you
But I know what you want is to figure it out
And God knows I do too
What can I do
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'll never ask for anyone but you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'll never ask for anyone but you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'll never ask for anyone but you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'll never ask for anyone but you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohI've got to breathe you can't take that from me
'Cause it's all that you left that's mine
You had to leave and that's all I can see
But you told me your love was blind
I know there are times you're so impossible
That I should sign a waiver
And you will find someone worth walking on
When you ask me to go
I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath and away it goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows
There was a day you threw our love away
Then you passed it to someone new
You wanna stay but since you wanna play
We can finally say we're through
I know there are times you're so impossible
And you ask me to go
I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath and away it goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows
You can scream there's just echoes
I'll pass outside of your window
You'll be sad that you let me go
I'll leave but just know
As I lay in solitude oh what's a boy supposed to do
I shake the very thought of you me together I remember
Late nights when I stayed up late all I do is wait and wait
You're never coming home to me that's the hardest thing to see
I've got to breathe you can't take that from me
I can finally say we're through
I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath and away it goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows
You can scream there's just echoes
I'll pass outside of your window
You'll be sad that you let me go
On every face you'll ever know
And everywhere you'll ever go
You'll feel when the wind blowsIt's a new day
It's a bright day
Even when you stand in the dark
It's just that
You've been broken into fifty pieces
Today is gone
I'm the only light that you see
You need someone
I know all you needed was me
Everyday we awake if it takes too long
Just tell me something new
Forget about the sunshine when it's gone
Another pale moon
Shines like high noon
Midnight never felt so cold alone
It's just that you're uneasy
When you need me
Today is gone
I'm the only light that you see
You need someone
I know all you needed was me
Everyday we awake if it takes too long
Just tell me something new
Forget about the sunshine when it's gone
You can say it's right but it feels so wrong
Just show me something true
Forget about the sunshine
Forget about the sunshine when it's gone
Today is gone
I'm the only light that you see
You need someone
I know all you needed was me
Everyday we awake if it takes too long
Just tell me something new
Forget about the sunshine when it's gone
You can think it's right but it feels so wrong
Just show me something true
Forget about the sunshine when it's gone
Everyday we wake if it takes too long
Just tell me something new
Forget about the sunshine when it's gone
You can think it's right but it feels so wrong
Just show me something true
Forget about the sunshine when it's gone
You can think it's right but it feels so wrong
Just show me something true
Forget about the sunshine
Forget about the sunshine when it's goneCan somebody save me
Cause I'm thinking maybe
That you can take me piece by piece
Then you got your reasons
But I didn't need them
And either way I'm on my knees yeah
You knew when I was wrong
You say that I'm deranged
I can see that you're uneasy and its not gonna change
And no matter how far
Wherever you go I'm calling
Either way you're breaking my heart
Wherever you go I'm crawling
Even when we're falling
Even when we're falling apart
You say that you're leaving
Say that you don't need him
And I'll I do is give and you just take
I guess that I knew it
I can't make it through it
But I'm gonna try this anyway
You knew when I was wrong
You knew that I'm deranged
I can see that you're uneasy and its not gonna change
And no matter how far
Wherever you
Wherever you go I'm calling
Either way you're breaking my heart
Wherever you go I'm crawling
Even when we're falling
Even when we're falling apart
Yeah looks like were fallin' apart
Anyone got it where the roses sleep
I can make you anything you wanna be
When my bodies close to me
I can give you anything you'd ever need
When I fall to the floor
Cause I can't feel anymore
You can have my heart girl
You don't have to steal anymore
When I look to the stars
Wherever you are
Wherever you go I'm calling
Either way you're breaking my heart
Wherever you go I'm crawling
Even when we're falling
Even when we're falling apart
Wherever you go I'm crawling
Wherever you go I'm crawling
Wherever you go I'm crawling
Even when we're fallin'
Even when we're fallin' apart
Yeah I guess we're fallin' apart
Yeah it looks like were fallin' apart
Yeah I guess I'm fallin' apartHere's another pity and there's another chance
Try to learn a lesson but you can't
We can burn a city in futures and in past
Without a change our lives will never last
We're going fast
You can sit beside me when the world comes down
If it doesn't matter then just turn around
We don't need our bags and we can just leave town
You can sit beside me when the world comes down
What can we do better when will we know how
A man says from a sidewalk to a crowd
If you can change the weather if you wanted it yourself
If you can't I guess we all need help I need help
You can sit beside me when the world comes down
If it doesn't matter then just turn around
We don't need our bags and we can just leave town
You can sit beside me when the world comes down
We say we do
The lies the truth
And all I need is next to me
We're going fast
You can sit beside me when the world falls down
If it doesn't matter then just turn around
You'll be the queen and I'll be your clown
You can sit beside me when the world comes down
You can sit beside me when the world comes downI never thought that I was so blind
I can finally see the truth
It's me for you
Tonight you can't imagine that I'm by your side
Cause it's never gonna be the truth
Too far for you
But can you hear me say
Don't throw me away
And there's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Everyday but all I have is time
Our loves the perfect crime
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me
Take everything that I know you'll break
And I give my life away
So far for you
But can you hear me say
Don't throw me away
There's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Everyday but all I have is time
Our loves the perfect crime
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me
Tonight I'm weak
It's just another day without you
That I can't sleep
I gave the world away for you to
Hear me say
Don't throw me away
There's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow
All I wanna do is touch you
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Everyday but all I have is time
Our loves the perfect crime
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Everyday but all I have is time
Our loves the perfect crime
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way and when they set me free
Just put your hands on meHold on tight
Wrap your arms around me til your knuckles are burning white
All your tears
Couldn't match the bitter taste of all these wasted years
You take take
Everything that wasn't even yours
Wait wait
You don't got a hold of me anymore
In a clear view there's a silhouette
And I watch you and I can't forget
Knew we were done when you locked that door
Yeah I figured it out now
Breaking's what the heart is for
When I see you in a silhouette
And you hold close
Do you feel regret
Keeping me down when I hit that floor
And I figured it out girl
Breaking's what your heart is for
For so long
I've had to bite my tongue but what's the point if the feelings gone
I turn my head
Learned I only see some memory but all I see is red
Don't don't
Say it didn't happen that way
I won't won't
Believe another word that you say
In a clear view there's a silhouette
And I watch you and I can't forget
Knew we were done when you locked that door
Yeah I figured it out now
Breaking's what the heart is for
When I see you in a silhouette
And you hold close
Do you feel regret
Keeping me down when I hit that floor
And I figured it out girl
Breaking's what your heart is for
Yeah breaking's what your heart is for
Yeah breaking's what your heart is for
And not a soul sleeps
Another heart skips a beat
It's every note that you wrote and I hope that you choke on the lines
You're wasting my time another heart beats tonight
In a clear view there's a silhouette
And I watch you and I can't forget
Knew we were done when you locked that door
Yeah I figured it out now
Breaking's what the heart is for
When I see you in a silhouette
And you hold close
Do you feel regret
Keeping me down when I hit that floor
And I figured it out girl
Breaking's what your heart is for
Yeah breaking's what your heart is for Blank face little girl
Your color's running down
Its the one you love
Cry out my world
This copulated kiss
Its the last that you deserve
Ive done wrong

Drink down and your candles burn
Away away
Dreaming you is so easy yeah
If it was up to me
Then you would cry tonight
If it was up to you
Take you take me

Dont you wish Id try
Left just a trace
It's growing colder still
So kiss yourself goodbye
Ive done wrong

One drink and your candles burn
Away away
Dreaming you is so easy yeah
If it was up to me
Then you would cry tonight
When it's up to you
You kiss yourself goodbye
Let go push your daisies
A thousand maybes
A thousand left I'm done
A white glow just for tasting
A life for wasting

And I look into your eyes
It's the one you love
Last one then I fill you up today today
How can you sleep
When dreaming you is so easy yeah
If it was up to me
Then you would cry tonight
When it's up to you
You kiss yourself goodbye
You would cry tonight

So kiss yourself goodbye

You would cry tonight
Hey you
So you never really found your way
Stay true
Did you ever make it through today
I know that when I think about a day without it
Everyday's the same
You wish that you could find someone
But I'm the only one to blame
Can't you see
I beg and plead
Cause when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know you're gonna find your way back to me
No don't
Don't you ever let a piece of me down
Cause time won't
Get back when I'm never around
When we live between so many walls
That I can barely breathe
You say that you just want someone
But I'm the only one you need
Can't you see
I beg and plead
Cause when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know you're gonna find your way back to me
If it's me
That you don't need
When the lights go out tonight I know
You're never gonna find your way
Soon when I get you I won't let you go
Oh if I let you
You can take away all that I thought was wrong
And if you hear me there's not much to say
There's gotta be a better way
Can't you see
I beg and plead
Cause when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know you're gonna find your way back to me
Cant you see
I beg and plead
Cause when the lights go out tonight
I know you're never gonna find your way
If it's me
That you don't need
That when the lights go out tonight
I know you're never gonna find your way
If you pace around the world
And when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know you're gonna find your way back to meI wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still probably working
At a nine to five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
Now where's your picket fence love
And where's that shiny car
And did it ever get you far
You never seemed so tense love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are
And truth be told I miss you
And truth be told I'm lying
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself
Where'd it all go wrong
But the list goes on and on
And truth be told I miss you
And truth be told I'm lying
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
Now you'll never see
What you've done to me
You can take back your memories
They're no good to me
And here's all your lies
You can't look me in the eyes
With the sad sad look
That you wear so well
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you hear this song and you sing along but you never tell
Then you're the fool I'm just as well
Hope it gives you hell
When you hear this song
I hope that it will treat you well
You can sing along
I hope that it puts you through hellYou're a no good heart breaker
You're a liar and you're a cheat
And I don't know why
I let you do these things to me
My friends keep telling me
That you ain't no good
Baby they don't know
That I'd leave you if I could
I guess I'm uptight
And I'm stuck like glue
'Cause I ain't never

Loved a man the way that I I love you
Some time ago I thought
You run out of fools
But I was so wrong

Surely Mr ticket agent you should understand
Destination anywhere

You see my baby don't want me no more
This old world ain't got no back door
'Cause every day it would swing both ways
And we'd go on back to happy yesterdays
When I loved him tenderly
And all he needed was me
As I stepped through the window of the train
I thought I heard my baby call my name
But it was just the conductor saying
Which stop would you prefer
Oh destination anywhere
East or west I don't care
You see my baby don't love me no more

Slip awayLook here girls take this advice and remember always in life
Into each heart some tears must fall
Though you love and loose you must stand tall
'Cause we all got to cry sometimes I said sigh sometimes
Pull yourself together no use crying forever
Because there's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
I said there's short ones tall ones fine ones kind ones
Too many fish in the sea
My mama once told me something and every word is true
Don't waste your time on a fella who doesn't love you
He'll only mislead you only grieve you
Don't worry about him baby you can do it without him
Because there's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
I said there's short ones tall ones fine ones kind ones
Too many fish in the sea
Well if that fish isn't on your line
Bait your hook and keep on trying
You don't let him get you down
There's other boys around
There's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
I said there's short ones tall ones fine ones kind ones
Too many fish in the sea
I don't want nobody that don't want me
Too many fish in the sea
Ain't gonna love nobody that don't love me now
Too many fish in the sea
I don't need nobody that don't need me
Too many fish in the sea
I don't want nobody that don't want me now
Too many fish in the sea
Ain't gonna love nobody that don't love me
Too many fish in the sea
Ain't gonna love nobody that don't love me now
Too many fish in the sea
I don't want nobody that don't want me
Too many fish in the sea
I don't want nobody that don't want me
Too many fish in the too many fish in the seaLounging back in their golden chairs
Plastic smiles surrounded by their plastic hair
Tiny microphone in his swollen hand
Screeching out their praises up to Bula Land
He can't wait to die
A crowd of zombies listen as they wail and cheer
He's likely to expire in another year
Rejoice hallelujah I want to die
I wanna see what happens in the blink of an eye
Overweight southern drawl dissonant voice
Glazed over cloudy gaze lacks a choice
Their eyes roll back as they raise their hands
I think I see it coming it's Bula LandWhy do you think the way you
Why do you act the way you
Why do you believe what you say that you believe
Torn apart between two worlds we stand on the outside
Bringing up the rear we come like lambs condemned to die
Can we ever truly separate the truth we strive to know
From the history behind us and the lies that we've been told
Soldiers are lined up baptized heading off to war
In the name of Jesus but what are they fighting for
Is this your foundation Upon what do you stand
When slipping sliding we stand tall All else is sinking sandBite the hand
The hand that feeds you needs you
Greeds you bleeds you
Grieves you leaves you
Greets you eats you
Bite the
They want what's best for you
They would never hurt you
You could never understand
In ignorance you bite the hand
Hand that supplies you denies you
Relieves you deceives you
Excites you unites you
Violates you sedates you
Bite theSee genetics singing out
The face of this race
The work of creation shouting out
Do you see the same or do you see
What's unique
With the Flesh the Blood the Bones
Here come the clones
With all their garbage with all their splendor
The breath of the spirit
We can never render
No blade identical no heart impermeable
How can you manufacture the holy spirit
Father bring life to Blood to Bones
Here come the clones
With all their garbage with all their splendor
The breath of the spirit we can never render
The Bodies are inhabited with life
The son of man
The power in no hierarchy forthcoming
Even the bereft of life will stand
As the trumpet drones raise the bones
Prophesy to light no man can elevate alone
We're not so different we're not the same
Hating brother's quality and beauty
Who are we
Human being's the name
With flesh with moans
We throw the stones
At all the garbage and all the splendor
At the spirit and hope that it can render
We fallRiots in the streets
Riots for revolution
People on their knees
Praying for revolution
Children overseas
Fighting for revolution
Soldiers cut and bleed
Dying for revolution
Waiting for revolution
To come
Politicians and priests
Fathers of revolution
Businessmen and beasts
Fathers of revolution
The hungry cry and plead
Pleading for redistribution
Change for all in need
Much needed revolution
Waiting for Revolution Redistribution
Waiting for Consideration Emancipation
Waiting for Reconciliation Reallocation
Waiting for Demonstration Salvation
Lie awake at night
Comfort too afraid to fight
Eyes not accustomed to sight
Wings not used to flight
Slavery and Abundance coming near
Resisting Revolution
Arrogance and Fear
Death to RevolutionEverywhere around us someone's got something to say
Isolated outbursts but nothing goes away
Everyday you hear the words of destruction and fear
Always spreading our opinions
Without the willingness to hear
All this noise about nothing drowning the meaning of it all
Outside this oral defecation the world is an empty stall
Injustice over here Hatred over there
Talk talk talk but the sin is everywhere
Words words wordsAll we have are these
Can we feed them to the poor or with them heal disease
Talk talk talkIs that all we will do
Sacrifice ourselves we must go die for what is true
Take in information through the lenses you create
Never do a thing about the things you say you hate
Surround yourself with people who say what you want to hear
What keeps you from action is it selfishness or fear
Talk about injustice do we really want it gone
It takes more than a zine or writing lyrics to a song
Scapegoat the middleclass if it covers up your guilt
No conviction penetrates the fortress you have builtLeft to negotiate with no sense of knowing
When freedom over truth has triumphed
Free to be lost and disconnected
Given as much value as free things often are
Keep me close to you Don't let me be alone
Discarded but not overthrown
I'm useless yes it's true
Keep me fresh and new Don't make me obsolete
I still have hands to wash your feet
My uselessness is you
I could be worth my weight in labor
I could be worth my death in favors
You could monitor my list of things to do
And you could overlook my anonymous service to you
The sum of my marketable skills
My part in the collective will
Abilities that you would own
And use in ways I don't condone
Produce and receive my meal
Discard me when I fall illI want change to happen
I want Social justice
I want Service Programs
No don't drink that wine
So many huge decisions
Are made in corporate board rooms
What about the streets of our city
Will we drink that wine Will we trust those who know
Will we venture out in faith Confess what we don't know
In a perfect world things are rarely what they seem
Reality could be a dream
Who will we listen to and who will we trust
Will we trickle down or will we trickle up
Who will decide what the answers will be
What do we want Rabbi we want to see
My mustard seed will grow
It's growing into a mountain mover
My crippled leg is showing
But I'm going to the head of the table
My worst his best most honored guest
The seed is growing stronger
Throw the mountains into the sea
Move the mountains inside of me
The mustard seed against the world
Perfect world imperfect world
I want Bottom Up justice
At the bottom of justice
Surely the wineskin of justice
Surely the cup of mercy
Will overflow into the streets of the world
Soon will come the time
To drink of His new wineI am an experiment
You are an experiment
We are all experiments
Denial of Oppression Justified Aggression
Imperial Invasion Nuclear Destruction
Rugged Individualism Ethnocentrism
Blatant Consumerism Blind Nationalism
Corporate Globalization Juvenile Fornication
Warehouse of Corrections Irrelevant Religion
Rhetoric of Revolution Economic Concentration
Make a good impression Irresponsible reproduction
A voice cries out in the wilderness
In a dry and desolate land
A voice of one is calling
Destruction is at hand
This is a land where no one travels
A land where no one lives
But a light shines in the desert
In the place where Darkness is
She will become the least of nations
A wilderness a dry land
But the wilderness will rejoice
Strengthen the feeble hands
Steady the knees that give way
Be strong and do not fear
The voice calling American Culture
Is a voice that all can hearInjustice runs rampant in society
You can even find it in our own pretty democracy
RunWell no
Or hide in a 9 to 5 and don't care to know
Impoverished and homeless don't have a choice
Well why should they The money took their voice
And it flows
Only prepare at the next media scare
Turn the TV on and tune out the sun
Opinions decisions seem so black and white
When we allow the media to chose our fight
Never talk of sex but condemn all abortion
Christian message is warped in transmitted distortion
Fell the sea sickening rush of the great capitalist flush
Spiraling down
The destruction of all that's in our way
When times get rough its time to pray
A Nation of greed
American apathy
A path and a blown away seed
Promoting self is the American way
Globalization of greed
Spiritual apathy
A path and a hollow seed
Structural collapse is on the way
We're living survival of the richest
Echoes rise up from the pit
As the pendulum cuts them down
And our American world spins around
Money makes money while the poor can only get poorer
Our economic equations include the bottom mans horror
Some free men sit in prisons while some slaves sit in office
Prejudice issues manage to linger
We need reconciliation not pointing a finger
So what is our ticket out now
Where do we find truth
Many have lost their minds or died
So we could indulge in our American pride
And now we glance at some at the corner
Who have been discarded and junked away
And forced they work up scams
To exist with me and you another day
Consume Pollute Hate Destroy
Let go of possession fear and pride
When witnessing injustice don't find a way to hide
Open our eyes to see every lie
Because you'll never find justice till the day
That you dieYou believe Man what a joke
There is nothing I can't see
My reality is my own creation
And standing in the center is me
Backup Lookout Step aside
The decision maker is coming through
On my road to pleasure and self
I'll crush your bones I'll step on you
We are not in control of this world
I stand or fall I live and breathe
By the choices I have made
I stand on the shoulders of no man
And stand on everyone just the same
My heroes are all smart men
They say control is not our own
Evolutionary Biology what a genius
Truth cannot be known
You must submit You must submit
There are creatures watching you
You lie and say they don't exist
But when you fall they pull you through
There's no dead carcass in the grave
But there's rivers of blood on my hands
Feel like I have lost control
But by the throne He still standsThe ideal for the practical
The exchange freedom for truth
The path you set out on
Someone will finish it
But it will not be you

'Cause you're a Dead Duck
You dug the hole that you've fallen into
Your lost hopes and Broken Dreams
Fallen away should have fallen asleep
Dark is your path can't see what stumbles your feet
Seduced by the times you who once were an heir
Our joys should all be doubled and our trials be shared

You are not alone it seemsFreedom is a luxury you can't afford
When you're working minimum wage at the corner store
When little children are preyed on in their own homes
When you're working at the factory
Making parts for your radio
Freedom is a luxury
Freedom is a luxury you can't afford
When you've walked all day and your feet are sore
When it's five miles to the next grocery store
When you're slaving over 40 hrs
Slaving for your slave's wage
Freedom is a luxury
Freedom is a luxury you can't afford
When you're working minimum wage at the corner store
When you've walked all day and your feet are sore
When you're slaving at the factory
Making parts for your radio
Slaving for your slaves wage
Freedom is a luxury you can't affordLove has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Ooh no no no
Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Ooh no no no no no
Just like an old cliche
One that simply says
You can't miss what you never had
I thought that love was just a feeling
That I'd give to him and in return
He'd give it back
But it's more than a friendly sensation
Oh I had to be tripping out on the girls
Body vibration
But I knew oh oh oh yeah
Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Oh no no no
I'm so glad I can stand here today and say
Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Oh no no no no no
Listen to me now
Just like a tender young virgin
In her first love affair
I doubt if she'd ever do it again
Would she even care
But as time pressed on
Ooh ooh the girl caught on
Nothing more she'd do with the boy
She seemed to want it want it want it
But there's one side of love
I'd never never never known
Baby until you came along
I can I can tell the world
Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Oh no no no
Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Oh no no no no no
Break it down to me easy
'cause everybody needs some kind
Of love in their life
Some kind of shape form or fashion
Some kind of shape form or fashion
Oh and just like the flowers need the rain
And they need they need love to grow
I got you baby
That's all you'll ever need
Chased away the blues in my life
You've got a way of making everything alright
Baby baby baby baby
Baby baby baby baby
Somebody understand me now
Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Ooh no no no
When something happen good to you
Seem like you just wanna
Let everybody know let everybody know
Ve has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Ooh no no no no no
Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Ooh no no no
Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Ooh no no no no no
Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Ooh no no noHurting inside
Simply because
It takes a lot of strength to say goodbye
Oh it's so hard to do
I wonder if I'm wrong
I thought the whole thing over
And I still can't tell you why
It's gone
Baby I can't accept the pain
That we bring
That we bring to each other
There's nothing to gain from hurting one another
So I'm walking in the rain
Looking for the strength to say goodbye
My man I want to call you
And say it's on again
It's not like I don't love you I don't love you any more
I thought the whole thing over
And it's not like it was before
You're gone you're gone
Just one too many times
You say you don't want me
And then apologize
'cause you know your love will haunt me
I hope I'm acting wisely
I'm walking in the rain
Looking for the strength to say goodbye
No more no more in the morning
No more no more crisis every night
This is not a warning
You've heard that before
Baby I'm tired I'm tired
I can't take it
I won't take it any more
My man I want to call you
And say it's on again
And it's not like I don't love you I don't love you any more
I thought the whole thing over
And I still can't tell you why
It's gone
And oh girl I can't accept the pain
That we bring that we bring
That we bring to each other
There's nothing to gain from hurting one another
So I'm walking in the rain
Oh I'm walking
Looking for the strength to say goodbye
Looking for the strength to say goodbye
That's what you got me doing baby
But oh it's so hard to do
I can't say goodbye to youI wanna dedicate this song to all the lovers tonight
And I expect that might be the whole world
Because everybody needs something or someone to love
When it's cold outside who are you holding
You know if y'all don't mind I'd like to talk about this woman of mine
She's always complainin' 'bout me never bein' at home
But when I'm down broke
She's tellin' me about the things that her girlfriend's got
What she ain't got and she wants me to go out and get 'em for her
But girl I can't be in two places at one time
If you think you're lonely now huh
Wait until tonight girl

I'll be long gone

And you'll find another man that'll treat you right

When I ain't there to rub your back

Just remember I made it a long fact
And it's gotta just come out of the closet
And chase you all around your room
And the memories sail 'round like a ghost
And that's a matter of fact no joke ah
If you think you're lonely now

Oh wait until tonight

I'll be long gone

And you'll never find another man that'll treat you right


You think you're lonely now

Wait wait wait until tonight girl
Oh ain't it funny how the tables turn
When things aren't goin' your way
But when love runs out and the pain walks in
And settles for a stay ooh

Lord help me I feel like I wanna testify


Girl wait until tonight

If you think you're lonely lonely now


Oh you just wait until tonight girl


You see tonight's the night when the needs come out
When your needs come out to breathe
And you toast the stars and there ain't now way you can sleep ooh

If you think you're lonely now

I feel like I wanna testify this evenin'

I'm lonely 'cause I know I gotta leave you oh girl

I just can't take no more

Ooh hoo hoo

Ah girl you just wait

If you think you got problems now baby you just wait

Wait

Too far gone

Like you're runnin' out

Ooh hoo ooh hoo babe

You say you're a little lonely

But everybody needs somebody to love


It's good that you know that you got somebody that'll stand by your side
That'll build you up when you're fallin' down

And you had that someone baby

'Cause I've done my time

And it's your turn now

If you think you're lonely now

Wait wait until tonight

I'm tired tired of this same old stuck in the hour

It's been too long

You think you could start all over again it's been too long

You think you could start it just one more time
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss how it felt the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you
When he says those words that hurt you do you read the ones I wrote you
Sometimes I start to wonder was it just a lie
If what we had was real how could you be fine
'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone
I admit I like to see them I admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy yeah it hurts that you've moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long
It's like we never happened was it just a lie
If what we had was real how could you be fine
'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
No I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at allHey There must be some way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
Oh I can't get no relief
Yeah yeah
Businessmen drink the wine
Plowmen dig the earth yeah
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth
Oh yeah all along the watchtower
All along the watchtower yeah
Ohh no reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There's many here among us yeah
Who feel that life is but a joke
All along the watchtower
Hey hey hey hey yeah yeah
Hey But you and I we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour's getting late getting late getting late
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind the wind began to howl out loudOh baby
Girl don't pull the rug from under my feet 
Don't leave don't leave me so I'm talking in my sleep
This could be the start of a nightmare
Waking up and not finding you there
It would be more that I could stand
Oh baby
Girl don't leave me so I'm pacing the floor 
'Cause that's that's what I'll do if you close the door
Maybe I've been too hungup on myself
But don't change me by putting my heart on a shelf
'Cause that's more than I could stand
Why you wanna leave me
Why you wanna go
I promise not
To never never hurt you no more
Oh please don't leave me
Please don't go
By causin' my heart to ache
Causin' it to break
We we've still got a lot of love to give 
So turn around baby 
While there's a lot of life to live
Leavin' me would ruin all of my plans
It would be like tying the both of my hands
And that's more baby than I could stand
Why you wanna leave me
Why you wanna goFly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On aJupiter and Mars
In other words hold my hand
In other words baby kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words please be true
In other words I love you
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words please be true
In other words in other words
I love youI was kind of dreaming
And my heart was making plans
Try to hold on
But it was falling through my hands
Did you hear me babe
Did I get close to your soul
Try to reach you
But I had to let it go
Like nothin' can save ya
A song fight took you there
You were never really mine
You lend get in the twilight
And slowly clip a tool way
Heavens hands you down
For a moment in my life
Thanks towards a wonder
Was a falling from the sky
Like nothin' can save ya
Was kinda of dreaming
And my heart was making plans
I tried to hold on
I tried to hold on
Did you hear me babe
Did I get close to your soul
I tried to reach you
But we had to let it go
Like nothin' can save ya
Never never neverI could try to say I'm sorry
But that won't be quite enough
To let you know the pain that I feel
And it just won't let up
Oh it feels like the sky is falling
And the clouds clouds are closing in
Where did I lose control
Where did it all begin
Please forgive my heart
It's not that the problem
Lies anywhere in there
I'm a liar
I'm in a dream
Going on my way
Nothing to rely on
There's a time
A silent witness
To the blindness of the night
And we see reflections so clear
In the blush blush of the morning light
Time can pass so slowly
When you're faced with burning down
The time is not commuted
It lingers lingers without a sound
Please forgive my heart
It's not that the problem
Lies anywhere in there
I'm a liar
I'm in a dream
Going on my way
Nothing to rely onThe earth is but a dayglo reflection
A time that will bring you only light
I'm falling to myself but I'm not going
Waiting for the day to bring me light
Is everything is that everything is everything
The only thing I ever dreamed is you and me
'Cause I've layed down I take you down
And I love it every step of your way
Watching from a distant constellation
Eyes I can see the world unchanging hills
There's still unfalling waiting
Time with you is that love is the only truth
Is everything is that everything is everything
The only thing I ever dreamed is you and me
'Cause I've layed down I take you down
And I love it every step of your wayCan't you see you're in quicksand
It's gonna take more than a hand to pull you out
It's like rowing on dry land
You keep sinking  deeper deeper
And the more you try to fight you keep getting weaker
There's only one way to do right
Is to leave wrong alone
Anything worth having won't come easy
And if it do boy  pass it on
You're in quicksand
It's gonna take more than a man to pull you out 
You keep sinking  deeper deeper
And the more you try to fight you kept getting weaker
There's only one way to do right
Is to leave  leave wrong alone
Anything worth having won't come easy
And if it do you better pass it on
 Quicksand
 Quicksand
You're sunk in quicksand
 Quicksand

 Y'all you've got yourself in a world of trouble 
Trouble Deep river my home is over Jordan

The bravest man in the universe

I always know how to come down
The bravest man in the universe
Is the one who has forgiven first
Yeah
Shame on me shame on you
It's up to us
What we say and what we do
Would you stay in the sun
Would you stay in the sun much too long

Shade that makes you feel at home
The bravest man in the universe
Is the one who can forgiven first
The bravest man in the universe
Oh ah
The bravest man in the universePreacher is preaching
How you should live
Instead of teaching
With the love they give
They ask for money
In the name of the Lord
And they line their pockets keep coming back for more
Dragging you down
Chipping away
Misleading you all with the things they say
What they feed you
Strive to believe
Giving you just enough to make you needy
By the time you wake up they're already gone
Looking for the next fool to come along
Dragging you down
Chipping away
Misleading you all with the things they say
Shatters your world
Spoiling your mind
Keeping your heart
Prayer divine
Dragging you down
Chipping away
Misleading you all with the things they say
Shatters your heart
Foiling your mind
Prayer divineOnce upon a time a good friend of mine
Told me to tell y'all what I say today
Do the things that keep a smile on her face
Say the words that make her feel better ev'ry day
You bet you better keep on you Ps and Qs
If you don't the woman you can easily lose
Oh I had a love a true love and I lost it
No one seems to understand about the pain that it cost me
Woman's got to have it
I believe that I should know
She's got to know that she's that she's needed around
When you kiss her
You got to make her feel it everyday boy
She's got to know that she's not walking on shaky ground
Think it over
Don't take for granted the smile upon her face
Check a little bit closer you might find a tear trace
Maybe the little girl never said a mumbling word
But she's got to know that her voice is heard
Oh I had a love it was a true love and I lost it
Now I'm suffering all this pain that the true love cost me
A woman's got to have it
I believe
She's got to know that she's that she's needed around
When you kiss her
You got to let her feel it everyday boy
She's got to know that she's not walking on shaky ground
So if you've got a love
And maybe you've got eyes to keep her
You've got to give her what she wants when she wants it
Where she wants it 
How she wants it
And every doggone time she thinks she needs it
Your woman needs it
The same as mine
A woman got to have it
From time to timeEverybody claims that they want the best things
Outta life but not everyone not everyone
Want to got through the toils and strifes
Like this particular fella walks around
All day long singing this song
Harry Hippie lies asleep in the shade
Life don't bug him cause he
Thinks he's got it made
He never worry about nothing in particular
Oh he might even sell free press on Sunset
I'd like to help a man when he's down
But I can't help him much
When he's sleeping on the ground
He's like a bottle in water
Harry just floats through life
Walks around all day long singing this song
Whoa whoa whoa oh yeah
Mary Hippie she's Harry's lady
Panhandles money just to feed Harry's baby
She can lie down a story so incredible
Man you want to help her take the food
Home and put it on the table
I'd like to help a man when he's down
But I can't help ya Harry
If you want to sleep on the ground
Sorry Harry you're too much weight
To carry around
But he still walks around all day singin' this song
Street child street child tell me where
Will you be goin'
When old man winter gets his horn
And starts blowin'
Will you hang around LA
Or hitch a ride on a freeway
Meet an old familiar face in a new place
I'd like to help a man when he's down
But how can I help him
If he's somewhere outta town
Sorry Harry think I'm gonna put you down
Everybody help me sing this song oh yeahI was the third brother of five
Doing whatever I had to do to survive
I'm not saying what I did was alright
Trying to break out of the ghetto was a day to day fight
Been down so long getting up didn't cross my mind
I knew there was a better way of life that I was just trying to find
You don't know what you'll do until you're put under pressure
Across 110th Street is a hell of a tester
Across 110th Street
Pimps trying to catch a woman that's weak
Across 110th Street
Pushers won't let the junkie go free
Across 110th Street
Woman trying to catch a trick on the street
Across 110th Street
You can find it all in the street
I got one more thing I'd like to y'all about right now
Hey brother there's a better way out
Snorting that coke shooting that dope man you're copping out
Take my advice it's either live or die
You've got to be strong if you want to survive
The family on the other side of town
Would catch hell without a ghetto around
In every city you find the same thing going down
Harlem is the capital of every ghetto town
Across 110th Street
Pimps trying to catch a woman that's weak
Across 110th Street
Pushers won't let the junkie go free
Across 110th Street
A woman trying to catch a trick on the street
Across 110th Street
You can find it all in the streetIf I told you told you told you
You were wrong
You get mad and say leave me alone
So I waited waited waited
To let you see
The women you love is in love with me
And she's so tired of being left alone
I know we're friends
But sometimes when love begins
That's when friendship ends
That's when friendship ends
I never never never
Thought it would be this way
You left her alone both night and day
When you were gone
Long gone such a long time
I was always there to keep her from crying
She was so tired of being left alone
I know we're friends
But sometimes when love begins
That's when friendship ends
So why don't you
Just shake my hand and walk away like a man
Help me somebody help me somebody
Now the girl the girl the girl
Means a world to me
Gonna make score
She gets what she need
But she ask me for love
I couldn't turn around
When she needed your love
You were never around
She was so tired of being left alone
I know we're friends
But sometimes when love begins
That's when friendship ends
I say That's when friendship ends
Help me somebody somebody
Oh somebody somebody somewhere
Somebody somewhere
It's too late
Is it too late
Oh love oh love
Love oh love love
Love will turn you against your own mother
And sometimes sometimes
It can turn you all the way around
Turn you against your sister
Turn you against your sister or brother
Yes it can now
So my friend my friend
This is it that's got to end
As I think as I think

But I am still hangin' around for you to enjoy

I'd give him the shirt off my back
He knows he can trust me with his life
But he's tryin' to leave me alone
Leaves me alone with his wife
I wish he didn't trust me so much
I think he really trusts me too much
How can he be so blind
We've both got the same good taste
He should know when he's gone on his business trips
I can't help watchin' his woman
'Cause I'm losin' my grip
I wish he didn't trust me so much
I think he really trusts me too much
Though I swear all is not my will
But there's a way
There's a way she make me feel
Lord I'm scared so scared of what I do
If she starts feelin' same way too
You shouldn't trust me so much

I think you really trust me too much
It's not that she leads me on
I'm gettin' there all by myself
But just being with her all all alone
I can't help but hopin'
That he never comes home
I wish he didn't trust me so much
I think you really trust me too much
I wish he didn't trust me so much

I think you really trust me too much
Though I swear all is not my will

But it's somethin' about the way
The way she makes me feel
Lord I'm so scared scared of what I do
If she starts feelin' the same way too
I wish he didn't trust me so much

I think he really trusts me too much

You can see I'm caught up

Caught up in the middle

And I'm down tired of playing Save the children and we might save the world
It's every mother's wish for her boy and girl oh
A child was born inside this city yesterday
His mother held him to her breast as she began to pray
Please let them grow up to be strong and know the truth
And have the chances to taste the innocence of youth
The innocence of youth the innocence of youth
You know what we have to do
Save the children and we might save the world
It's every mother's wish for her boy and girl oh
A baby starts out with his back against the wall
He has to learn to survive before he learns to crawl
He needs somebody who can give him a daddy hand
We brought them into this world they deserve a chance
They deserve a chance got to have a chance
Why can't we all understand
Save the baby save him ohh ohh save him
The world is lost in a bout of confusion
Happiness happiness happiness is just an illusion
Somewhere it must end even if we have to start
Stop and start again we're defendin' a man's sin
Oh what's going on what's going on
I can remember another friend of mine tellin' me
Change gonna come oh yes it will
Save the children and we might save the world
Every mother's wish for her boy and girl oh
Save save the children save save the children
Save save the children we gotta save the children
Save save the children save save the children
Save save the children we gotta save the children
Listen headed in the wrong direction
No love no love no love no love no love no love and affection
Like a pain we tryin' to figure it out
No young boys playin' in the park and havin' fun
They find their manhood at the barrel of a loaded gun
Can't see their future just a tunnel with no light
I'm lost in the projects runnin' from the night
Runnin' from the night runnin' from the night
Runnin' from the night runnin' from the night
Scared for the rest of their life
Save save the children save save the children
Save save the children save save the children
We gotta save the children save save the children
Save save the children
Stop stop stop stop stop
We've got to stopOh how I miss you baby
Oh how I miss you baby
Listen to me
It's only been a week ago
But it seems like years
And it's getting sort of hard
To see through tears
'Cause now you're gone
And I know for myself
That I can't find happiness
With nobody else
Oh how I miss you baby
Oh how I miss you baby
Listen to me
I find myself calling out your name
In the middle of the night
And I still hear you saying darling
No no two wrongs don't make it right
I thought I could cope it all alone
But I was so wrong
'Cause it didn't gain me one solitary thing
But an unhappy home
Oh how I miss you baby
Oh how I miss you baby
I wanna say sorry
Oh but it ain't a strong enough word
For once in my life I'm so sincere
And I mean every word
I listen to what my friends had to say
But ooh they messed me up again
'Cause I haven't seen a good day baby
Since you know when
I never thought it could ever
Affect me this way
But I'm drownin' in a sea of misery
And all I can think of to say
Oh how I miss you baby
Oh how I miss you baby
I've got to keep on singing
Oh how I miss you baby
I swear I swearLost in a full time fantasy
I used to walk around lookin' for someone
Someone someone will love me
Oh why I thought that dreams were out of reach for me
And my heart had seized to beat
Then you came you came and you touched me
Now I am feelin' my heart beat again
And I feel I could win this time
Falling in love again
And I am feelin' my heart beating so fast
And I feel it could last with you
Falling in love again
Falling in love again
Caught in a mystic reality
That's the way I felt that moment I laid eyes on your soul
And in a while you became the fire
That kissed me warm from the cold
The only one I wanna hold
Can't you see you make love me so much more
And I am feelin' my heart beat again
Don't have to pretend no more
Falling in love again
And I am feelin' my heart beat so fast
Feel it could last with you
You got me falling in love again
Falling in love again
Right now right now
I am feelin' my heart beat again
I feel I could win this time
'Cause you got me falling in love again
And I am feelin' my heart beat so fast
I feel it heal at last with you
'Cause I am falling in love again
Falling in love againWell once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money no I didn't care
Takin' my friend John out for a mighty good time
Buyin' highpriced liquor champagne and wine
Then I began to fall so low
Didn't have a friend nor no place to go
If I get my hands on a dollar again
I'm goin' to hold on to it until the eagle grins
Soon as I get back up on my feet again
Everybody wants to be my longlost friend
It's might strange without a doubt
Nobody wants you when you're down and out
Lord soon as I get up on my feet again
Everybody wants to be my longlost friend
It's mighty strange without a doubt
Nobody wants you when you're down and out
That's what I mean when you're down and outTalk to me
What's the matter baby
I couldn't sleep at all last night
Thinkin' 'bout our silly fight
Hangin' on to foolish pride
Though it's killin' killin' me inside
After all that we've been through
How could somethin' like this
Come between me and you
Here we are with our backs to each other
Acting more like strangers than lovers
You stay on your side
And oh I'll stay on mine
Someone's got to give in
And I guess I guess it's me this time oh
I can't stay mad too long no I can't
Not when this feelin' I have for you
Is much too strong
Why do we have to play this game
When there is nothin' to be gained
Let's fight and get it over with
Instead of treating each other each other like this
Think of what we're standin' over
I don't know what we're tryin' to prove
'Cause after we get it straighten out baby
We won't remember what we were arguing about
And I've made the first move
Oh and it lasted long enough
Here we stand in silence
And we should be kissin' kissin' and makin' up
'Cause I I can't stay mad too long no I can't
You can be right this time
And I may be wrong oh I'd be wrong
I don't mind I don't mind
Oh no 'cause I can't stay mad too long
Listen to me baby
You can be right this time
And I may be wrong
I don't care what it costs me
Oh I can't stay mad too long
No we know it is wastin' time
Girl we can Tell her she look beautiful every day
A woman needs to hear that yes she do
Let her know that she's special
In the things that she do each day
A woman needs to hear that like that
Send her pretty flowers
And a message so sweet
A woman got to have that
Like you still turn my head
When you walk down the street
Oh a woman wants to hear that

Just another communication
It could help the situation
It's not the generation
That keep gettin' on this nation
What I say what I say
What I say what I say
We've made this world what it is today
For the way we live and what we do and say
The pitiable show in the eye of need
You close my eyes every time I don't see
What I'm sayin' what I'm sayin'
Well look at here
Disgusting one another
But still callin' me your brother
And listen to me now
Now if you believe in what I am sayin'
I'll be back take a slam
Like I say like I say like I say
Say like I say like I say
All we need is just a little communication
That could make this world a better nation
Just like the preachers congregation
They're all in to his conversation
What I say what I say
Oh Lord good God
Don't put down your brother
On the way he dress
I am gettin' tired
And sick of your mess
Ooh and if you believe
Oh Lord I know you believe in what I am sayin'
And I want every man to take a stand
All you gotta to is help me
Help help help me
Why don't you help me
Help me help me help me sing this song
Just a little communication

If you see your brother fallin' down
Give him a chance to make him come around

Funny how time things done changed
Just to think that you swore you loved me baby

I'm even going along with the latest dances
But I think rrue love true love still remains the same
Lookin' back on my yesterdays
True love didn't go that away I can remember it Well now
Once you said you love somebody
that vow you couldn't dare to break
I don't understand it that's what you've done
How could you break my heart How could you break my heart

See It wasn't no big thing to me no way
See I've had a whole lot of oil around you know
I mean a whole lots of things around

goin' over the hill Now now now now
Now how long we've been together
Hey girl you let me down
what made it so bad
Naw Naw Naw
''Spoken''
Pick my guitar help yourselfosing your sense of pride
and crawling through to dark
He was all but over looked
by the readers of Fleet Street
Confronted by a similar emotion
I've been up for 4 nights
trying to get some sleep that never came
A come around
a come around
a come around
See my art decay
Screaming and Dreaming
It's all tied up come take a look
I've been crawling on the floor
looking for the door I can't get outWell some things never change
You'll never see this face again
I'm out sleeping with the stars in the shallow end
'Life' is just a word I don't want to say
I don't care if tomorrow is a new day
I'll write the song again
How about the one who thought life wasn't his friend
Why would he want the words to be shared
When no one listens and no one cares
I'd skip this fucking song
if you don't want to know whats fucking wrong
Did you hear my acceptance speech
I quit I quit i fucking quit
You don't want to know why i can't quite talk
You don't want to know what makes my heart stop
You wrote my requiem
with no words no life just desperation
There's no truth like the lie I live
I'm a sinking ship drowning by a burning bridge
There's no cure for the Dreamer's Disease
I'm a boat of false hope lost at sea
Today tonight tomorrow
I am truly by myself
you don't want to know why I can't quite talk
you dont want to know what makes my heart stop
You say those fucking words but what the fuck do they mean Nothing
Life is just a word that I won't say
Love is just a word that I'll never know
Life is just a game that I wont play
Love is just a lie that I wont believeI ran through
Storm stained city streets
Paved with pain
To bring these roses to you
And with sore throat insecurity
You pulled the thorns
From my bleeding side
There were winter days
Spent in  sulking  side
Try to heat cold sheets
Hide allergy eyes
I'm now hanging out with destiny
And begging it to get the best of me
What else can I do
Why do you read me
Like no one else
Used to live headaches
Now they're somewhere else
We are handguns angel
Waiting to explode
We've lived cold lives
But now we know
The sun may hide
But the night is always there
So don't anticipate
It's not worth the wait
What did you expect
Status report I've called it a day
There's a world of people
Different than me
Status report I've lost my voice
Trying to be heard over this noise
Die young or live forever
I'm just trying to get through the night
See there's this voice
Dragging me down
Die young or live forever
I'm just trying to refind my heart
It was always there
Just hard to see in the dark
You weren't even looking
Sleeping like there's no tomorrow
Sleeping like there's no tomorrowWhatever this becomes
Whatever words I say
We are the fortunate ones
And when the days are done
I won't forget
All I see in you and me
Is a light in the dark of humanity
And when the days are done
I won't forget
Timid steps  come walk with me
And with your useless words
Come talk to me
There are broken hearts
Now on your stereo
But the broken beats are just too slow
You'll cry  it doesn't change a thing
Kill the lights  and let the rain fall
Recall  the memories
Of yesterdays and better ways
And know  the innocence is gone
Move on  from this day on
We'll never be the same
The saddest songs
Make sense to me
So with your sunken eyes
Come look for me
Two hour drives
Are two hours alone
But two hour drives
Are better than home
You'll die  it doesn't change a thing
You will  kill the lights
And let the rain fall  recall
The memories of yesterdays
And better ways
And know  the innocence is gone
Move on  from this day on
We'll never be the same
Faster words  and faster kids
Faster songs  and faster ends
The one thing that's stayed the same
I've lived through days
I've lived through nights
I've had my loves
I've had my fights
You gotta know  you have my heartDear eastern prom
I know what's wrong
But it's suicide eyes
That wrote this song
For all I'm worth
Writer's block is a bitch
Words falling like bricks
For a New England wish
I was an easy male fuck
In the town of naivefly
All I wanted was a shot in the dark
But like a knife through the heart
I choke on spit covered words
Oh my god  It happened again
What's wrong with me
Screaming gets you nothing
One more night in this town
And I swear that I'm dead
I drew a heart
Around the name of your city
Right here all by myself
I ain't got no one else
The situation is bleeding me
There's no relief for a person like me
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression i gotta break free
Depression's got a hold on me
Depression's gonna kill me
I ain't got no friends to call my own
I just sit here all alone
There's no girls that want to touch me
I don't need your goddamn sympathy
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression i gotta break free
Depression's got a hold on me
Depression's gonna kill me
Everybody just get away
I'm gonna boil over inside today
They say things are gonna get better
All i know is they fuckin' better
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression i gotta break free
Depression's got a hold on me
Depression's gonna kill me
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression i gotta break free
Depression's got a hold on me
Depression's gonna kill meI want to spend the night
With you
Forever
Every time we wind up spending the night
Together
Do you ever feel it
I want to share my life
With you
Forever
Ever time we wind sharing a night
Together
Do you ever feel it
And when I stay away from you
I never get to sleep
I try to hug my pillow
And pretend that you're with me
But I can't feel it
Then when we are together
It's right there for me to see
I can't keep looking at loneliness
And trying to call it freedom
Do you ever feel it
I want to spend the night
With you
Forever
Every time we wind up spending the night
Together
Do you ever feel it
Do you ever want to spend the night
Do you ever want to spend the night
Do you ever want to spend the night
Do you ever want to spend the night
Do you ever want to spend the nightMay not know enough about you babe
That can only come in time
Only know enough to make you stay
On my mind
Though I met you only yesterday
And only for a moment then
I knew I couldn't let you get away
I just can see you girl
I can be the one you love
Let me be the one you need
Take a look into your heart
Try to find a place for me
Can't say I can't live without you babe
That's just some worn out loser's line
May not know enough about you babe
But you stay on my mind
I can be the one you love
Let me be the one you need
Take a look into your heart
Try to find a place for me
I can be the one you love
Let me be the one you need
Take a look into your heart
Try to find a place for me
I can be the one you love
Let me be the one you need
Take a look into your heart
Try to find a place for me
I can be the one you love
Let me be the one you need
Take a look into your heartA Hello like before
I'd never come here
If I'd known that you were here
I must admit though
That's it's nice to see you dear
You look like you've been doing well
A Hello like before
I hope we've grown
'Cause we were only children then
For laughs I guess we both can say
'I knew you when'
But then again that's kiss and tell
Hello like before
I guess it's different
'Cause we know each other now
I guess I've always known
We'd meet again somehow
So that it might as well be now
Hello like before
I hope we've grown
'Cause we were only children then
For laughs I guess we both can say
'I knew you when'
But then again that's kiss and tellSteppin' right along

Forever
Heavenly Father
Sweet heavenly Father

Sweat ol' Heavenly FatherWhatever happens
We'll have some love along the way
But it ain't easy
We'll look for some words of love to say
And smilemmmmm
It may happen anyway
And we'll kiss before we say 'goodnight'
And whatever happens
They're'll be some time along the way
When it ain't easy
It just can't be sunshine everyday
We'll smilemmmmm
And be happy anyway
And we'll kiss before we say 'goodnight'
I've got you in my life
Together we can reach the higher ground
We'll be alright
Just as long as you're around
Girl I won't let you down
Whatever happens
There'll be some good times and some bad
But it ain't easy
Let's just remember the good times that we had
And just smilemmmm
And be happy anyway
And we'll kiss before we say 'goodnight' Watching you watching me
It's so easy to see
That it's my loving you
That puts the starlight in your eyes
Watching me watching you
It's so obviously true
That it's your loving me
That makes my life a paradise
When lovers meet
And light a spark
Their eyes give the game away
Somehow it's a feeling you can never hide
No matter how hard you try
When lovers speak
It's from the heart
And all of the things they say
Are part of the magic and the mystery
You hear in a gentle sigh
Watching you watching me
Girl ain't it easy to see
That it's my loving you
That puts the starlight in your eyes
Watching me watching you
Girl I believe that it's true
That it's your loving me
That makes my life a paradise
The times we had
The fun and games
The things that I can't forget
We share in those very special memories
All lovers do smile about
I'm so glad you feel the same
There's nothing to regret
It's free for the simple love is there for you
To bring all the feelings out
Watching you watching me
Girl ain't it easy to see
That it's my loving you
That puts the starlight in your eyes
Watching me watching you
Girl I believe that it's true
That it's your loving me
That makes my life a paradise
There's a language
Spoken only by lovers
Words and phrases
That they make with their eyes
You might try it
But you'll never change things
No one comes
Let's celebrate what life's about
Let's sing out the melody
The words and the music to our song of love
Are sweeter than anything
'Cause if we wait
We might lose out
On things that were meant to be
With all of the secrets that the heart can hold
Left dangling on a string
Watching you watching me
Girl ain't it easy to see
That it's my loving you
That puts the starlight in your eyes
Watching me watching you
Girl I believe you know that it's true
Sweet girl that I love you
You make my life a paradise
When I'm kissing my love
I can hear a thump thumping in my head
When I'm kissing my love
I close my eyes and see a pretty city with a million flower beds
I can hear the angels sing
Songs that only angels sing
And I can feel my heart just athumping and askipping
When I'm kissing my love
When I'm kissing my love
I feel the blood pumppumping in my veins
When I'm kissing my love
She's such a tender send with a sweet young frame
She's so good at what she does
All she wants to do is kiss and hug
She's got me in love
And I can feel my heart just athumping and a skipping
When I'm kissing my loveSummer night in Harlem
Man it's really hot
Well it's too hot to sleep
And too hot to eat
I don't care if I die or not
Winter night in Harlem
Oh oh radiator won't get hot
And that mean ole landlord
He don't care if I freeze to death or not
Saturday night in Harlem
Ahh every thing's alright
You can really swing and shake your pretty thing
The parties are out of sight
Sunday morning here in Harlem
Now every body's all dressed up
The heathen folk just getting home from the party
And the good folk just got up
Our crooked delegation
Wants a donation
To send the preacher to the holy land
Hey hey lord honey don't give your money
To that lying cheating manA man we passed just tried to stare me down
And when I looked at you
You looked at the ground
I don't know who he is
But I think that you do
Dadgummit
Who is he and what is he to you
Something in my heart and in your eye
Tells me he's not someone just passing by
And when you cleared your throat
Was that your cue
Dadgummit
Who is he and what is he to you
Now when I add the sum of you and me
I get confused when I keep coming up with three
You're too much for one man
But not enough for two
Dadgummit
Who is he and what is he to you
Well you tell me men don't have much intuition
Is that what you really thinking girl
Or are you wishing
Before you wreck your old home
And search for another new
Dadgummit
Who is he and what is he to you
Dadgummit
Who is he and what is he to you
Dadgummit
Who is he and what is he to you
Dadgummit
Who is he and what is he to youI don't want you on my mind all the time
I believe that it shows a sign of weakness
I don't want no lonely nights that gets me cryin'
I found out I don't get nowhere with weakness
Every dream about you
I just wake up knowing that I've got to do without you
I don't want all the time doin' up my mind
I don't want you on my mind all the time
I don't want you on my mind all the time
I believe that it shows a sign of weakness
I don't want no lonely nights that gets me cryin'
I found out I don't get nowhere with weakness
Every dream about you
I just wake up knowing that I got to do without you
I don't want all the time doin' up my mind
I don't want you on my mind all the timeCity of the angels spread your wings for me
I've been other places looking for my dream
Eastern cities move to fast
Southern ones to slow
I can't go back to my past
And I need someplace to grow
City of the Angels
Clear your cloudy skies for me
I heard you got some places that I ought to see
Heard you got a Disneyland not to far away
When it rains I understand the skies are clear all day
LA LA find a place for me
Give me all your spaces please
It's where I want to be
City of the Angels spread your wings for me
I heard you got some places an old man like me should see

For people whom I've known that now are gone

REPEAT Chorus Ritard Ending last note up the octaveWhen I was a little boy back in West Virginia
We lived very close to a railroad track
And I remember I used to dream about them trains
And where they might go
And the people that worked on the trains
And the train made music it made you feel good
I can remember sometimes
I could just stand off all by myself
And just get funky listenin' to the train
And I used to pick up a handful of gravels
And throw 'em down on the ground for ties
Yeah and I'd make up songs I'd sing
He was a railroad man
He was a railroad man
He was a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train
He rode across the plains
He rode on a fruit freight train
The hauled bananas to Savannah
And wore bandannas made in old Japan
He was a railroad man
He was a railroad man
And a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train
He used to change his name
To every place he came
You know his name was Tex when he's in Texas
And Bangor when he went to Maine
And a railroad man
No he was a railroad man
And a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train
Used to change his name
To every place he came
You know his name was Tex when he's in Texas
And Bangor when he went to Maine
He rode across the plains
He rode on a fruit freight train
The hauled bananas to Savannah
Wore bandannas made in old Japan
And he was a railroad man
He was a railroad man
Oh a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train
Used to change his name
 to every place he came
His name was Tex when he's in Texas
And Bangor when he went to Maine
You know he was a good time railroad man
Good time railroad man
Oh a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train
It's alright
Say you know it's alright
If you've ever been downtown
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You know he was a good time railroad road
Good time railroad man
Oh a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train
He used to change his name
To each and every place he came
You know his name was Tex when he's in Texas
And Bangor when he went to Maine
He rode across the plains
He rode he rode on a fruit freight train
The hauled bananas to Savannah
And wore bandannas made in old Japan
Oh railroad man
Oh railroad man
Oh railroad man
Stepped in front of the railroad trainYour love is like a a chunk of gold
Hard to gain and hard to hold
Like a rose that's soft to touch
Love has gone and it hurts so much
Well and why
Must the same love that made me laugh
Make me cry
Well now you think of love as sitting on a mountain
Think of it as being a great big rock
Won't you think before you started to roll it down
Because once you start it you can't make it stop
I've given all I have to give
And if you don't want me
I don't want to live
Well and why
Must the same love that made me laugh
Why you want to make me cry
Why you want to make me cry
Why you want to make me cry
Why you want to make me cry
Why you want to make me cry
Why you want to make me lay in my pillow
Just cryin' like a weeping willow
Why you want to make me cry
Why you want to make me cry
Why you want to make me cry
Why you want to make me cry
Why you want to make me mess in my pillow
I'm just cryin' like a weeping willow
Why you want to make me cry
Why you want to make me cry
Why you want to make me cryWonder who is waiting for me
At the end of Heartbreak Road
Hope that she'll be tender
Someone I can know
Heartaches just don't last forever
But it's a lonely road
A road we all must travel
Once before we go
I believe that love's a good teacher
When you're in it
And even if it don't work out
You ain't gone never understand it
'Til you're all down in it
And find out what it's all about
But that's all right because
Heartaches just don't last forever
But it's a lonely road
A road we all must travel
Once before we goMake a smile for me
Lately I've been so lonely
And a smile from you
Might make these blues go away
Stay awhile with me
Can't you tell I've been lonely
And a smile from you
Might make it a nicer day
Close your eyes and dream of a sunny place
Watch the world light up when you smile
Stay with me and smile at me sunny face
Chase the clouds away with your smile
Close your eyes and dream of a sunny place
Watch the world light up when you smile
Stay with me and smile at me sunny face
Chase the clouds away with your smileYou want to take me to a doctor
To talk to me about my mind
To try to give directions to some places
That I don't really want to find
Trouble in me is not related
To things that I might say or do
I'm really not that complicated
Your good doctor friend he oughta talk to you
I notice that he can't remember
Things that he never should forget
And why does he spend his evenings
Smoking them funny cigarettes
I have a friend that knows your best friend
He goes some places where she goes
He said he saw y'all at a party
Sniffing white powder up your nose
You got the nerve to call me narrowminded
'Cause I'm not loose and indiscreet
But people lying down always get blinded
By people standing on their own two feet
Life is just a shadow
That I just can't seem to find sometimes
But I guess I'll make it
'Cause I found out that it's really in my mind
You shouldn't take it too seriously
'Cause it really ain't gone' last too long
You really only got two choices
You can lay down and be weak
Or you can stand up where you're at
And still be strong
Tomorrow depends too much on today
And yesterday all that gentleman is to you is gone
All you find out looking back
Is the fact that both of us was wrong
Both of us was wrong
You're talking right to me
But you really ain't saying a thang
You're pouring muddy water on me
Trying to convince me it's rain
You're talking to me crazy
But you're trying to make me feel insane
You're like a Sunday family
Digging animals in a zoo
But while you're looking at monkeys
Monkey's looking dead at you
Two people getting done
Trying to figure out who's doing who
If you're throwing dirt at people
You got to get some dirt on you
I got to take a tone of lies
Just to get an ounce of truth from you
You're like a man loving Jesus
That says he can't stand a Jew
Get on down and play the dozens
Talk about four folks
From your mamma to your cousins
You down there
You know what I'm talking 'boutProbably one of the nicest affections in the world
Is that feeling that's there between
A worldly old uncle and very innocent young niece
Liza won't you lay your head on my shoulder
Cry if you want to I don't mind
Seems as if you need some love and kindness
And all I've got is time
Wiser is the way when you grow older
Nothing heals a broken heart but time
I know what it means to need a shoulder
So lay your head on mine
Wiser is the way when you grow older
Nothing heals a broken heart but time
I know what it means to need a shoulder
So lay your head on mineCan We Pretend
Can we pretend
That from now on
There is no yesterday
Paint a portrait of tomorrow
With no colors from today

There's a light that shine in your face sometimes
That takes my feeling wraps them around your need
But there's shadow hiding in your heart sometimes
That makes my feelings turn back in on me
Can we pretend
The pain is gone
And go our merry way
Paint a portrait of tomorrow
With the colors bright and gay
Staring at shadows on the wall
Wish I knew of someone I could call
Someone who might understand it all
Ruby Lee I show wish you was here with me
Someone's lying with me in my bed
Some stranger who don't understand my head
Wish it was you lying here instead
Ruby Lee I show wish you was here with me
Drowning in a sea of pretty faces
Being quite the man about the town
Packing up and going different places
But I show miss having you around
I listen to the noises down the hall
Think I'll move out of here in the fall
I ain't exactly having me a ball
Ruby Lee I show wish you was here with meLooking out at the people looking in
Feeling good must be some kind of sin
Looking in at the people looking out
Feeling guilty scared to move about
Looking up at the people looking down
Taking tranquilizers by the pound
Looking down at the people looking up
Getting mad 'cause they can't get enough
Ah but that green grass on the other side
Is just an illusion
We all have our own confusion
Rich people watching the people poor
Trying to figure out how to get some more
Poor people watching people rich
You know they call them dirty youknowwhich
Ugly people watching the people pretty
Say they can't get down to the nittygritty
Pretty people watching people ugly
Say I sure couldn't stand you to kiss and hug me
Ah but that green grass on the other side
Is just an illusion
We all have our own confusionWho will buy a glad story
That a young man has to tell
Come into my house of glory
And I will treat you well
Who will buy a sad story
That a widow has to tell
Come into my house of lonely
And I will treat you well
Young and old we all have stories
That we all must try to sell
Tales of how you get to heaven
And how we been through hell
Who will buy a perfumed story
That a young girl has to tell
Sleep with me on satin pillows
And I will treat you wellWhen I wake up in the morning love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning love
Bears heavy on my mind
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
A lovely day
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
A lovely day
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
A lovely dayI see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you sometime
And I want to spend some time with you
Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I
We look for love no time for tears
Wasted water's all that is
And it don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait
Not for those who wait too late
We gotta go for all we know
Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I
I hear the crystal raindrops fall
On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
And darling when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I want to be the one with youAin't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
And I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know I know
I know I know
Hey I oughtta leave young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes awayShe couldn't stand me anymore
so she just took the kids and went
You see I've got a drinkin' problem
all the money that we had I spent
Now I must die by my own hand
'cause I'm not man enough to live alone
Hey hey she's better off without me
and I'm better off dead now that she's gone
Ah she gave the most took the least
she even had the priest come to our home
And I cried and prayed and promised
that I'd leave the stuff alone
Now I must leave what I can't face
I hope she finds the kids a happy home
Hey hey she's better off without me
and I'm better off dead now that she's gone
She used to call her friend and cry
then the man cut off the telephone
She'd sit and cry while I went out
and pawned the things we owned
Now I must die by my own hand
'cause I'm not man enough to live alone
Hey hey she's better off without
me and I'm better off deadOne of us has to say he's sorry or we will never be freinds again

what you're running from
tomorrow might just be another day to run
If you just sit and waste your time you'll be
going where you're coming from 
tomorrow might be just another day to run
Someone must control your mind
you're the one
dark confusion's what you find when you run
I don't want to waste your time but I'm talking
to you like a son
Tomorrow might be just another day to run
Walking down the road of life looking for direction sometimes
my mind gets so mixed up I can't tell lust from affection
Gonna stop in to a roadside church and get my mind a rest
and Lord Jesus help me get my soul together in the process
Pretty ladies stand in line waiting for inspection
ragged old men drinking wine trying to drown rejection
I've been wasting too much time I'm going to lose my
mind unless Lord Jesus
You help me get my soul together in the process
I see Tony Jr fill up his arm with dope and dream
about a valley but he lives in an alley
filled with papers thrown away  Lord tell me
He's long on dreams and short on hope and sometimes
he goes to rallies and stops by to see Sally just
to pass the time away
Lord tell me Tony tell me why do you want to get high
enough to dieSometimes in our lives we all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow
Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on
Please swallow your pride
If I have faith you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
That you won't let show
You just call on me brother when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on
Lean on me when you're not strong

If you need a friend call me uh huh if you need a friend 
If you ever need a friend 
Call me call me call me
 call me if you need a friend
 call me call me call me call me Maybe the lateness of the hour
Makes me seem bluer than I am
But in my heart there is a shower
I hope she'll be happier with him
Maybe the darkness of the hour
Makes me seem lonelier than I am
But over the darkness I have no power
Hope she'll be happier with him
I can't believe that she don't want to see me
We lived and loved with each other so long
I never thought that she really would leave me
But she's gone
Maybe the lateness of the hour
Makes me seem bluer than I am
But in my heart there is a shower
Hope she'll be happier with himYou can live your life in a crowded city
You can walk along a crowded street
But the city really ain't no bigger than the friendly
People friendly people that you meet
You might be a sweet young sweet young pretty pretty
And at the dances you can't keep your seat
But if dances don't lead to romances
You might as well be born be born with two left feet
You might be a sweettoned sure 'nuff highclass talker
You might be a stone stone expert at kissing
But it don't do too much good to be talkin'
Brother when there ain't no ain't nobody lis'nin'
And if you are shy just not much of a talker
Don't impress the people that you meet
You might as well be a lonely walker in a lonely town on a lonely streetBusy hanging curtains
Children in the way
Woh That's what the future holds with me
Don't you want to stay
Better talk to Billy
His doggie died today
Woh That's what the future holds with me
Don't you want to stay
Chorus
Don't you won't to stay
Woh Don't you want to stay
That's what the future holds with me
Don't you want to stay
Sundays in the meadow
See the children play
Who That's what the future holds with me
Don't you want to stayBaby I'm feeling
Sort of lonely
I heard the news today
Somebody told me
That you were leaving
And I just you up called to say I
I still love you I love you baby
I know you won't believe me
When I say
For another chance I'll make it up to you baby
Don't give me up no
Don't throw in the towel
'Cause I just want you to know I still
I still love you I love you baby
I know I'm guilty
Just like you said
But baby oh baby don't
Don't throw our love away oh
They say love is better
Second time around
But I don't believe in taking chances
Your love is sweeter
Than any love I've found
And I just wanna call you up and say I love you I love you baby
I love you tomorrow just like I did today
Oh lord I love you I love you lord baby I love you oh
Ooh you my daily throb and my midnight dreamLately I'm beginning to see signs
That you've got leaving me on your mind
I get a cold cold feelin when I touch you
It's hard to face but I know the truth

You see the handwriting is on the wall
I just looked up and read it all
You're getting ready to call it off
The handwriting is on the wall
The handwriting is sure on the wall
Lately when I want to make love to you
You say you're too tired or some other excuse
I might as well quit foolin' myself
There just ain't much love between us left

Lying round home alone On a rainy night like this
Starving for your love Hungry for just one kiss
Every rain drop I hear Against my window pane
Beats so loud and clear words that spell your name

I got nowhere to turn
Tired of being alone
I feel like breaking up somebody's home
I know it's useless
Hanging on to you when you belong to someone else
Can't change my feelin' child
Cause after all I didn't make it myself
Last night I cried so hard I believe I caught a chill
Can't control the vibration My heart just won't stand stillOh yeah I'll get along
The hill is hard to climb
The road get rough and rugged
Make me wish that I was back in my buggy
But I get along I get along
I get along I get along you know I will
'Cause if a dog in the street
Can find himself a bone
I get along yeah I get along
Now lovin' you baby made me a poor chooser
You can bet your life this time

Why don't you take the chains from my heart and set me free
Day after day

Everybody around you knows

He tried to explain last night
She was still his man
All night long you tried to understand
Don't it make you want to get you get up get up and walk away
Say things you never would say
How do I know

Did you ever have to stand there
On the outside lookin' in
You know the man you love
Belongs to your best friend
Try to blow it out of your mind
You know your wastin' your time
You know somebody's gotta loose
Will you be the one to win
Don't it make you wanna get up
And walk away
Say things you never thought you would say
I've been there beforeI don't lend my man
I don't lend my man
I don't mind bein' a good neighbor
Lending my friends a helpin' hand
I don't mind doin' them a favor
Just as long as I don't include my man
'For my money I can live without
People if you you don't pay me back
I'll lend anything I got
As long as you understand that I
Just don't lend my man don't lend my man

'Cause it's too late for us to cry
If we had known what we had goin' on
We would've never let this feeling die
We let a love vibration pass us by
We let a love vibration pass us by
I can still recall the feeling
Boy you made me feel so good inside
Because we both had been used by love before
We thought this feeling we had to hide
We let a love vibration pass us by
We let a love vibration pass us by
Neither one of us played the game by the rules
I was too busy being tough and you were too busy being cool
The next time around I'll be ready
If the feeling ever comes my way again
I won't be a fool
I'll play the game by the rules
I won't let this feeling get away from me again
We let a love vibration pass us by
We let a love vibration pass us by
We let a love vibration pass us byThere's a troubled man confused within
Stumbling in darkness because of sin
Slipping and tripping with somebody else's love
Taking bitter with the sweet
Traveling the wrong way on a one way street
There's a sad heart all wrecked with pain
Look at the sad face filled with shame
Walking on troubled ground where I don't belong
Taking bitter with the sweet
Traveling the wrong way on a one way street
You know it's wrong this way of living
Sometimes you have to take less than what you're giving
But right now I'm satisfied taking bitter with the sweet
Traveling the wrong way on a one way street
Traveling the wrong way on a one way street
Walking the wrong way on a one way street
Slipping and tripping with somebody else's love
Taking bitter with the sweet
Traveling the wrong wrong wrong
Wrong wrong way on a one way streetAll I can give you is my very best
And when I do that I ain't gonna worry about the rest

You try and I try

Like other people
We're gonna be too busy bein' in love

This could last forever
All we need to do is give some kinda sign
Yes Lord
From then on baby it's easy
Let's talk about me and you
Me and you
Let's get away
Me and youTwo time loser
Two times I'm a loser
Two time loser
All because I tried to play the game
Once I had me a sweet girl
Oh boy what a neat little girl
I didn't know how much she really cared for me
So now I what real trouble can be
I played around with one of her friends
I didn't know just what I was gettin' into
I acted a fool and told her friend I dug her
And I came on like the world's sweetest lover
Now I'm a two time loser
Two times I'm a loser
Two time loser
All because I tried to play the game
As I want to lose you baby
Once I got you back I'll never let you go again
I've made a mistake for the very last time now
My baby please give me some kind of sign
I want to know if you will ever love me again
Now baby I want to be more than your friend
Other fellows can play the fool
This time darling I'm gonna keep my cool
'Cause two times I'm a loser
Two times I'm a loser baby
Two timesWhen a boy falls in love
He thinks of one girl
He wants to try to get a little thing goin'
Strange expressions on his face is showin'
He gets an old rag and he shines his shoes
And patches the holes in his favorite suit
I'm the one who knows
I'm the one who really knows
After school he walks her home
And when he gets home he gets on the phone
Tells his baby that he missed her so
When he just seen her five minutes ago
He talks an hour he hangs up and then
Picks up the phone and calls her back again
I'm the one who knows
I'm the one who really knows
At night she's in his dreams heh
And boy if you could just see the scene
Hehe's all dressed up in a hero suit
A long cape with stars on his boots
He rescues her from a fallen plane
They fly away to a far off land
And live a life that's really grand
I'm the one who knows
I'm the one who really knows
I'm the one who really knows
I'm the one who really knowsIf you want it better come and get it

Say who got the bluesI wish I could make music like that but I'm glad I can't
Sometimes you gotta love the simple sound of an amp
The crack and the pop is what makes the music hop
A clicktrack playin bounces titties to watch
Everything is better when it's perfectly pitched
Digital technology will make you rich
Now where is Millie Vanillie now that we got this shit
I'm gonna slap a hoe and I'll maybe slap a bitch
With these cool sounds it don't matter what you say
It's down and true even if it ain't real
'cause I hurt myself today
to see if I still feel
the needle skips and scratches the song
you can make music if your pitch is wrong
just grab a buddy and sing along
'cause if we get together then we can't be wrong
so the more we get together together together
the more we get together the happier we'll be
'cause your friends are my friends
and my friends are your friends
the more we get together the happier we'll be
now let's get drunk and sing outotune
blame it on the alcohol like the jaimie foxx dude
this music's much better with a bottle of booze
but if you make it sober then there's no excuse
chorus
If I sound bad then I'm proud of it
Don't have to use equipment to sound like shit
LA LA LA LA LA LA LA Another OutOTune Hit
Buy my fuckin' album and make me rich
and I promise I'll make another OutOTune HitAll the little people are walkin' down the street
All the little people and they don't know how to meet
all the little people and their heads are looking down
all the little people walking on their little ground
Everytime I run around I end up where i'm comin' from
And everytime I turn around I don't know what it is i've done
Everytime I run around I end up where i'm comin' from
everyone is walkin' and they don't know who they are
everybody talkin' but they don't know what they are
everybody lookin' down but no one wants to make a sound
'cause everyone is lookin' round but doesn't want to tear it down
Everytime I run around I end up where i'm comin' from
And everytime I turn around I don't know what it is i've done
all the little people and they walkin' kind of funny
all the little people and they don't they got no money
Everytime I run around I end up where i'm comin' from
And everytime I turn around I don't know what it is i've done
LaLaLa
all the little voices and the people do not hear
all the little people here and all the little people there
and all the little people to never to be seen
look at all the people and they losing all their dreamsOne evening as the moon came out and we had a joint a burning
Down the alley came a punk rocker and he said dudes I'm not turning
I'm headed for a town that's far away does my face look like Im clownin
So come with me we'll go and see the Punk Rock Candy Mountains
In the Punk Rock Candy Mountains there's a show that lasts all night
And they never charge a cover and youll never see a fight
The taxis drive ya around for free and no one gets in your way
No bloods or G's and no hippies
And no one clings to their one night flings
In the Punk Rock Candy Mountains
In the Punk Rock Candy Mountains you can never break your legs
And for the price of a forty ounce you can buy yourself a keg
Cause stores are made for you to loot and ya never gotta pay
Oh I'm bound to go where there ain't no snow
Just the kind that you put up your nose
In the Punk Rock Candy Mountains
In the Punk Rock Candy Mountains you'll never see a clock
And the little streams of PBR come atrickling down the rocks
The shows are neverending and the bands are all unsigned
There's a joint for you go head take two
Cause you can always do what you wanna do
In the Punk Rock Candy Mountains
In the Punk Rock Candy Mountains the jails are made of tin
And you can walk right out of them as soon as you are in
There ain't no fuckin' assholes no douchebags cops or dicks
I'm agoin' to stay where you drink all day
Where they hung the jerk that invented work
In the Punk Rock Candy Mountains
In the Punk Rock Candy Mountains you'll never go to court
There are no processing fees and no unpaid child support
The skateparks are full of life and ya never wait in line
No falsification they call taxation
There's no violation of fuckin' probation
In the Punk Rock Candy Mountains
I'll see you all this comin' fall in the Punk Rock Candy MountainsFind a good job and don't make a fuss
You're payin' all your bills so forget what you love
'Cause you'll be payin' bills till you're ashes and dust
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
He found himself a band and gave all his time
Played a hundred shows and never saw a dime
So he put on a suit and he gave up his rhyme
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
He calls himself an artist and does all your chores
He calls himself an artist and cleans all your floors
And never will you know him as anything more
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
He can't get the day off to play at his show
There goes another job and that's how it goes
Just to play a show for some people he knows
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
Sits at a desk and files their sh*t
Like he gives a f*ck if the company takes a hit
He'd rather be at home smoking weed with his friends
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
Delivers your pizza while sippin' on gin
Drives his car away and he does it again
He's gotta be drunk just to keep comin' in
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
They defile your food and smile to your face
Please come again if you like what you taste
It's a gourmet cuisine featuring today's artist's waste
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
You know inside who you really are
You don't need a paycheck or an imported car
Now let's go to work and find out who we are
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
He pulls your car over and searches your stuff
While his partner's laughing as they throw on the cuffs
When will they know when enough is enough
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
Working Class Bullsh*t is something to see
If you want to make it far then don't look at me

I heard Jesus smoked weed
I heard Jesus smoked weed
Was the holy man from Galilee
Well i heard jesus smoked weed
No place to call home not a thing to eat
JC and his apostles loved to chief
They roamed around the land and tried to teach
Preached about the gospel and THC
Now all the little kids is smoking weed
They all be swinging stoned and free
Why is all the children toking trees
'Cause they all heard that Jesus smoked weed
Don'tcha wanna be like Jesus
Don'tcha wanna be like Jesus
Don'tcha wanna be like Jesus
Don'tcha wanna be like Jesus
Don'tcha wanna be like Jesus
Don'tcha wanna be like Jesus
Don'tcha wanna be like Jesus
Don'tcha wanna be like JesusYou left me here to suffer
You left me dying alone
It's only made me stronger
Your day  your day will surely come
But for now I lay in wait
Full of bitterness and filled with hate
Can you see the pain you caused me
You will feel the pain you caused me
Empty promises written in stone
Betrayed and left alone
I'm drowning in my mysery
Because of you I lost my sanity
Because of you I will never love again
Because of you I will never love again
But now I lay I wait
But for now I lay in wait
Full of bitterness and filled with hate
Can you see the pain you caused me
You will feel the pain you caused me
Empty promises written in stone
Betrayed and left alone
I'm drowning in my misery
Because of you I lost my sanity
Haunted by memories of a love
That left me filled with pain
I will never love again
I replaced your love with hate
Never love againAfter all these years I can't just turn my back
All the blood the sweat and all the tears
You've got to earn your respect
Well what the fuck do you want from me
Cause you don't give a fuck about my scene
And I could give two fucks about you
Stop living vicariously through
You're running around like some old school star
But we don't know who you are
You dropped out  after a year
I know you're fake  you're fucking insincere
You're gone longer than you were here
Well now you're back and we don't care
We didn't build the scene for you to disgrace it
I didn't make a name for myself fo you to claim it
To you this is just another trend
But I'll be representing hardcore to the bitter end
The few the proud it's a way of life
Me and my friends always side by side
Cause we've got respect for each other
I treat my motherfucking friends like brothers
We didn't build the scene for you to disgrace it
I didn't make a name for myself for you to claim itWill I ever get to where I'm going
Will I ever follow through with what I had planned
I guess it's possible that I have been a bit distracted
And the directions for me are a lot less in demand
Will I ever get to where I'm going
If I do will I know when I'm there
If the wind blew me in the right direction
Would I even care
I would
I take a look around
It's evident the scene has changed
And there are times when I feel improved upon the past
Then there are times when I can't seem to understand at all
And yes it seems as though I'm going nowhere
Really fucking fastI wish  I wish that I had known
I would've never let you go
I was  I was too blind to know
I should've never let you go
I didn't know  when I had you
Taken for granted  now I've lost you
I never realized what you meant to me girl
I never knew we were meant to be girl
I can only blame myself
For the pain that I feel inside
I will always blame myself
For the love  I tried to hide
Too afraid of the pain you'd cause  I hurt myself
Memories of the loves  that I'd lost
You're the one I'll never forget
Losing you  is my one regret
I wish  I wish that I had known
I would've never let you go
I was  I was too blind to know
I should've never let you go
Well now it's too late and you're far away girl
I think about you every single day girl
Too afraid of the pain you'd cause
Memories of the loves I'd lost
And now you're just another memory
But I think about you every single day
And now you're just another memory
But I think about you every single day
You're the one  I'll never forget
Losing you is my one regretWhat happened to you and me
One moment changed everything
It's done and there's no way to take it back
Mistake gave me the pain I never had
There is no way to justify it so
Now I breathe in and let it go
This is the end of everything
Goodbye my only
I hang my head and I give in
Goodbye my only friend
Part of me I'll never see
Come visit me in my dreams
I feel my actions are destroying me
Deep down below the shallow life I lead
The pain is mine to keep and call my own
I'll carry it until I'm gone
This is the end of everything
Goodbye my only
I hang my head and I give in
Goodbye my only friend
I can't fogrive myself that I let go
My life is worth no more than yours I know
This is the end of everything
Goodbye my only
I hang my head and I give in
Goodbye my only friendLet's take it all away
Replace it with everything that we have made
Let's start over again
I'm putting pen to page
And right now I'm all clichs
But words will fade try to keep me awake

And I know
This is it
This is greater than anything
Let's take slow
It's too late
This is greater than anything
Let's have it all our way
Replace it with everything that we have made
We're counting the days
And chasing the nights away
I'll leave this place with a smile on my face

You give me more than you could know
You set me free don't let me go
I'm consumed by the idol of you
In my head i wish i never knew
Twists and turns but i cant let it go
Still I wonder why did i have to know
Oh oh
Running through the details
Oh oh
Tried to quit but I failed
Oh oh
I attempt to exhale
I take a deep breath in
And now i gotta let it go oh
This is haunting me so oh
Watch it cast a shadow
Waste my life let it go
Why did i have to know

All the mess that it made

How can i be saved
Twists and turns but i cant let it go
Still I wonder why did i have to know
Oh oh
Running through the details
Oh oh
Tried to quit but I failed
Oh oh
I attempt to exhale
I take a deep breath in
And now i gotta let it go oh
This is haunting me so oh
Watch it cast a shadow
Waste my life let it go
Why did i have to know
Why did i have to know
Why did i
Oh oh
Running through the details
Oh oh
Tried to quit but I failed
Oh oh
I attempt to exhale
I take a deep breath in
And now i gotta let it go oh
This is haunting me so oh
Watch it cast a shadow
Waste my life let it go
Why did i have to knowIts time to punch the clock
To get back on the bus
And go back to our socalled 'home'
This situation stinks
Of familiarity
Mixed up with fear of the unknown
Let's go run away
Now we suffer through everything
We try to please everyone
Its not easy to do
Emotionally drained
Don't remember every name
Of every person that I meet
We're all so hard to please
Expectations so heavy
And the television makes me sad
Now we suffer through everything
We try to please everyone
Its not easy to do
Now we suffer through everything
We try to please everyone
Its not easy to do
And now I try to be your best friend
Id die to be your best friend
But its all up to you
